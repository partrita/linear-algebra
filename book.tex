\section{Chapter 1. Vectors}\label{chapter-1-vectors}

\subsection{1.1 Scalars and Vectors}\label{11-scalars-and-vectors}

A scalar is a single numerical quantity, most often taken from the real
numbers, denoted by \(\mathbb{R}\). Scalars are the fundamental building
blocks of arithmetic: they can be added, subtracted, multiplied, and,
except in the case of zero, divided. In linear algebra, scalars play the
role of coefficients, scaling factors, and entries of larger structures
such as vectors and matrices. They provide the weights by which more
complex objects are measured and combined. A vector is an ordered
collection of scalars, arranged either in a row or a column. When the
scalars are real numbers, the vector is said to belong to \emph{real}
\(n\)-dimensional space, written

\[\mathbb{R}^n = \{ (x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n) \mid x_i \in \mathbb{R} \}.\]

An element of \(\mathbb{R}^n\) is called a vector of dimension \(n\) or
an \emph{n}-vector. The number \(n\) is called the dimension of the
vector space. Thus \(\mathbb{R}^2\) is the space of all ordered pairs of
real numbers, \(\mathbb{R}^3\) the space of all ordered triples, and so
on.

Example 1.1.1.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  A 2-dimensional vector: \((3, -1) \in \mathbb{R}^2\).
\item
  A 3-dimensional vector: \((2, 0, 5) \in \mathbb{R}^3\).
\item
  A 1-dimensional vector: \((7) \in \mathbb{R}^1\), which corresponds to
  the scalar \(7\) itself.
\end{itemize}

Vectors are often written vertically in column form, which emphasizes
their role in matrix multiplication:

\[\mathbf{v} = \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 0 \\ 5 \end{bmatrix} \in \mathbb{R}^3.\]

The vertical layout makes the structure clearer when we consider linear
combinations or multiply matrices by vectors.

\subsubsection{Geometric Interpretation}\label{geometric-interpretation}

In \(\mathbb{R}^2\), a vector \((x_1, x_2)\) can be visualized as an
arrow starting at the origin \((0,0)\) and ending at the point
\((x_1, x_2)\). Its length corresponds to the distance from the origin,
and its orientation gives a direction in the plane. In \(\mathbb{R}^3\),
the same picture extends into three dimensions: a vector is an arrow
from the origin to \((x_1, x_2, x_3)\). Beyond three dimensions, direct
visualization is no longer possible, but the algebraic rules of vectors
remain identical. Even though we cannot draw a vector in
\(\mathbb{R}^{10}\), it behaves under addition, scaling, and
transformation exactly as a 2- or 3-dimensional vector does. This
abstract point of view is what allows linear algebra to apply to data
science, physics, and machine learning, where data often lives in very
high-dimensional spaces. Thus a vector may be regarded in three
complementary ways:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  As a point in space, described by its coordinates.
\item
  As a displacement or arrow, described by a direction and a length.
\item
  As an abstract element of a vector space, whose properties follow
  algebraic rules independent of geometry.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Notation}\label{notation}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Vectors are written in boldface lowercase letters:
  \(\mathbf{v}, \mathbf{w}, \mathbf{x}\).
\item
  The \emph{i}-th entry of a vector \(\mathbf{v}\) is written \(v_i\),
  where indices begin at 1.
\item
  The set of all \emph{n}-dimensional vectors over \(\mathbb{R}\) is
  denoted \(\mathbb{R}^n\).
\item
  Column vectors will be the default form unless otherwise stated.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Why begin here?}\label{why-begin-here}

Scalars and vectors form the atoms of linear algebra. Every structure we
will build-vector spaces, linear transformations, matrices,
eigenvalues-relies on the basic notions of number and ordered collection
of numbers. Once vectors are understood, we can define operations such
as addition and scalar multiplication, then generalize to subspaces,
bases, and coordinate systems. Eventually, this framework grows into the
full theory of linear algebra, with powerful applications to geometry,
computation, and data.

\subsubsection{Exercises 1.1}\label{exercises-11}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Write three different vectors in \(\mathbb{R}^2\) and sketch them as
  arrows from the origin. Identify their coordinates explicitly.
\item
  Give an example of a vector in \(\mathbb{R}^4\). Can you visualize it
  directly? Explain why high-dimensional visualization is challenging.
\item
  Let \(\mathbf{v} = (4, -3, 2)\). Write \(\mathbf{v}\) in column form
  and state \(v_1, v_2, v_3\).
\item
  In what sense is the set \(\mathbb{R}^1\) both a line and a vector
  space? Illustrate with examples.
\item
  Consider the vector \(\mathbf{u} = (1,1,\dots,1) \in \mathbb{R}^n\).
  What is special about this vector when \(n\) is large? What might it
  represent in applications?
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{1.2 Vector Addition and Scalar
Multiplication}\label{12-vector-addition-and-scalar-multiplication}

Vectors in linear algebra are not static objects; their power comes from
the operations we can perform on them. Two fundamental operations define
the structure of vector spaces: addition and scalar multiplication.
These operations satisfy simple but far-reaching rules that underpin the
entire subject.

\subsubsection{Vector Addition}\label{vector-addition}

Given two vectors of the same dimension, their sum is obtained by adding
corresponding entries. Formally, if

\[\mathbf{u} = (u_1, u_2, \dots, u_n), \quad 
\mathbf{v} = (v_1, v_2, \dots, v_n),\]

then their sum is

\[\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v} = (u_1+v_1, u_2+v_2, \dots, u_n+v_n).\]

Example 1.2.1.\\
Let \(\mathbf{u} = (2, -1, 3)\) and \(\mathbf{v} = (4, 0, -5)\). Then

\[\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v} = (2+4, -1+0, 3+(-5)) = (6, -1, -2).\]

Geometrically, vector addition corresponds to the \emph{parallelogram
rule}. If we draw both vectors as arrows from the origin, then placing
the tail of one vector at the head of the other produces the sum. The
diagonal of the parallelogram they form represents the resulting vector.

\subsubsection{Scalar Multiplication}\label{scalar-multiplication}

Multiplying a vector by a scalar stretches or shrinks the vector while
preserving its direction, unless the scalar is negative, in which case
the vector is also reversed. If \(c \in \mathbb{R}\) and

\[\mathbf{v} = (v_1, v_2, \dots, v_n),\]

then

\[c \mathbf{v} = (c v_1, c v_2, \dots, c v_n).\]

Example 1.2.2.\\
Let \(\mathbf{v} = (3, -2)\) and \(c = -2\). Then

\[c\mathbf{v} = -2(3, -2) = (-6, 4).\]

This corresponds to flipping the vector through the origin and doubling
its length.

\subsubsection{Linear Combinations}\label{linear-combinations}

The interaction of addition and scalar multiplication allows us to form
\emph{linear combinations}. A linear combination of vectors
\(\mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_2, \dots, \mathbf{v}_k\) is any vector of the
form

\[c_1 \mathbf{v}_1 + c_2 \mathbf{v}_2 + \cdots + c_k \mathbf{v}_k, \quad c_i \in \mathbb{R}.\]

Linear combinations are the mechanism by which we generate new vectors
from existing ones. The span of a set of vectors-the collection of all
their linear combinations-will later lead us to the idea of a subspace.

Example 1.2.3.\\
Let \(\mathbf{v}_1 = (1,0)\) and \(\mathbf{v}_2 = (0,1)\). Then any
vector \((a,b)\in\mathbb{R}^2\) can be expressed as

\[a\mathbf{v}_1 + b\mathbf{v}_2.\]

Thus \((1,0)\) and \((0,1)\) form the basic building blocks of the
plane.

\subsubsection{Notation}\label{notation-2}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Addition: \(\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}\) means component-wise addition.
\item
  Scalar multiplication: \(c\mathbf{v}\) scales each entry of
  \(\mathbf{v}\) by \(c\).
\item
  Linear combination: a sum of the form
  \(c_1 \mathbf{v}_1 + \cdots + c_k \mathbf{v}_k\).
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Why this matters}\label{why-this-matters}

Vector addition and scalar multiplication are the defining operations of
linear algebra. They give structure to vector spaces, allow us to
describe geometric phenomena like translation and scaling, and provide
the foundation for solving systems of equations. Everything that
follows-basis, dimension, transformations-builds on these simple but
profound rules.

\subsubsection{Exercises 1.2}\label{exercises-12}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Compute \(\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}\) where \(\mathbf{u} = (1,2,3)\) and
  \(\mathbf{v} = (4, -1, 0)\).
\item
  Find \(3\mathbf{v}\) where \(\mathbf{v} = (-2,5)\). Sketch both
  vectors to illustrate the scaling.
\item
  Show that \((5,7)\) can be written as a linear combination of
  \((1,0)\) and \((0,1)\).
\item
  Write \((4,4)\) as a linear combination of \((1,1)\) and \((1,-1)\).
\item
  Prove that if \(\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v} \in \mathbb{R}^n\), then
  \((c+d)(\mathbf{u}+\mathbf{v}) = c\mathbf{u} + c\mathbf{v} + d\mathbf{u} + d\mathbf{v}\)
  for scalars \(c,d \in \mathbb{R}\).
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{1.3 Dot Product, Norms, and
Angles}\label{13-dot-product-norms-and-angles}

The dot product is the fundamental operation that links algebra and
geometry in vector spaces. It allows us to measure lengths, compute
angles, and determine orthogonality. From this single definition flow
the notions of \emph{norm} and \emph{angle}, which give geometry to
abstract vector spaces.

\subsubsection{The Dot Product}\label{the-dot-product}

For two vectors in \(\mathbb{R}^n\), the dot product (also called the
inner product) is defined by

\[\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} = u_1 v_1 + u_2 v_2 + \cdots + u_n v_n.\]

Equivalently, in matrix notation:

\[\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} = \mathbf{u}^T \mathbf{v}.\]

Example 1.3.1.\\
Let \(\mathbf{u} = (2, -1, 3)\) and \(\mathbf{v} = (4, 0, -2)\). Then

\[\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} = 2\cdot 4 + (-1)\cdot 0 + 3\cdot (-2) = 8 - 6 = 2.\]

The dot product outputs a single scalar, not another vector.

\subsubsection{Norms (Length of a
Vector)}\label{norms-length-of-a-vector}

The \emph{Euclidean norm} of a vector is the square root of its dot
product with itself:

\[\|\mathbf{v}\| = \sqrt{\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{v}} = \sqrt{v_1^2 + v_2^2 + \cdots + v_n^2}.\]

This generalizes the Pythagorean theorem to arbitrary dimensions.

Example 1.3.2.\\
For \(\mathbf{v} = (3, 4)\),

\[\|\mathbf{v}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{25} = 5.\]

This is exactly the length of the vector as an arrow in the plane.

\subsubsection{Angles Between Vectors}\label{angles-between-vectors}

The dot product also encodes the angle between two vectors. For nonzero
vectors \(\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v}\),

\[\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} = \|\mathbf{u}\| \, \|\mathbf{v}\| \cos \theta,\]

where \(\theta\) is the angle between them. Thus,

\[\cos \theta = \frac{\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v}}{\|\mathbf{u}\|\|\mathbf{v}\|}.\]

Example 1.3.3.\\
Let \(\mathbf{u} = (1,0)\) and \(\mathbf{v} = (0,1)\). Then

\[\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} = 0, \quad \|\mathbf{u}\| = 1, \quad \|\mathbf{v}\| = 1.\]

Hence

\[\cos \theta = \frac{0}{1\cdot 1} = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \theta = \frac{\pi}{2}.\]

The vectors are perpendicular.

\subsubsection{Orthogonality}\label{orthogonality}

Two vectors are said to be orthogonal if their dot product is zero:

\[\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} = 0.\]

Orthogonality generalizes the idea of perpendicularity from geometry to
higher dimensions.

\subsubsection{Notation}\label{notation-3}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Dot product: \(\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v}\).
\item
  Norm (length): \(|\mathbf{v}|\).
\item
  Orthogonality: \(\mathbf{u} \perp \mathbf{v}\) if
  \(\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} = 0\).
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Why this matters}\label{why-this-matters-2}

The dot product turns vector spaces into geometric objects: vectors gain
lengths, angles, and notions of perpendicularity. This foundation will
later support the study of orthogonal projections, Gram--Schmidt
orthogonalization, eigenvectors, and least squares problems.

\subsubsection{Exercises 1.3}\label{exercises-13}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Compute \(\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v}\) for \(\mathbf{u} = (1,2,3)\),
  \(\mathbf{v} = (4,5,6)\).
\item
  Find the norm of \(\mathbf{v} = (2, -2, 1)\).
\item
  Determine whether \(\mathbf{u} = (1,1,0)\) and
  \(\mathbf{v} = (1,-1,2)\) are orthogonal.
\item
  Let \(\mathbf{u} = (3,4)\), \(\mathbf{v} = (4,3)\). Compute the angle
  between them.
\item
  Prove that
  \(|\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}|^2 = |\mathbf{u}|^2 + |\mathbf{v}|^2 + 2\mathbf{u}\cdot \mathbf{v}\).
  This identity is the algebraic version of the Law of Cosines.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{1.4 Orthogonality}\label{14-orthogonality}

Orthogonality captures the notion of perpendicularity in vector spaces.
It is one of the most important geometric ideas in linear algebra,
allowing us to decompose vectors, define projections, and construct
special bases with elegant properties.

\subsubsection{Definition}\label{definition}

Two vectors \(\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v} \in \mathbb{R}^n\) are said to be
orthogonal if their dot product is zero:

\[\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} = 0.\]

This condition ensures that the angle between them is \(\pi/2\) radians
(90 degrees).

Example 1.4.1.\\
In \(\mathbb{R}^2\), the vectors \((1,2)\) and \((2,-1)\) are orthogonal
since

\[(1,2) \cdot (2,-1) = 1\cdot 2 + 2\cdot (-1) = 0.\]

\subsubsection{Orthogonal Sets}\label{orthogonal-sets}

A collection of vectors is called orthogonal if every distinct pair of
vectors in the set is orthogonal. If, in addition, each vector has norm
1, the set is called orthonormal.

Example 1.4.2.\\
In \(\mathbb{R}^3\), the standard basis vectors

\[\mathbf{e}_1 = (1,0,0), \quad \mathbf{e}_2 = (0,1,0), \quad \mathbf{e}_3 = (0,0,1)\]

form an orthonormal set: each has length 1, and their dot products
vanish when the indices differ.

\subsubsection{Projections}\label{projections}

Orthogonality makes possible the decomposition of a vector into two
components: one parallel to another vector, and one orthogonal to it.
Given a nonzero vector \(\mathbf{u}\) and any vector \(\mathbf{v}\), the
projection of \(\mathbf{v}\) onto \(\mathbf{u}\) is

\[\text{proj}_{\mathbf{u}}(\mathbf{v}) = \frac{\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v}}{\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{u}} \mathbf{u}.\]

The difference

\[\mathbf{v} - \text{proj}_{\mathbf{u}}(\mathbf{v})\]

is orthogonal to \(\mathbf{u}\). Thus every vector can be decomposed
uniquely into a parallel and perpendicular part with respect to another
vector.

Example 1.4.3.\\
Let \(\mathbf{u} = (1,0)\), \(\mathbf{v} = (2,3)\). Then

\[\text{proj}_{\mathbf{u}}(\mathbf{v}) = \frac{(1,0)\cdot(2,3)}{(1,0)\cdot(1,0)} (1,0) 
= \frac{2}{1}(1,0) = (2,0).\]

Thus

\[\mathbf{v} = (2,3) = (2,0) + (0,3),\]

where \((2,0)\) is parallel to \((1,0)\) and \((0,3)\) is orthogonal to
it.

\subsubsection{Orthogonal Decomposition}\label{orthogonal-decomposition}

In general, if \(\mathbf{u} \neq \mathbf{0}\) and
\(\mathbf{v} \in \mathbb{R}^n\), then

\[\mathbf{v} = \text{proj}_{\mathbf{u}}(\mathbf{v}) + \big(\mathbf{v} - \text{proj}_{\mathbf{u}}(\mathbf{v})\big),\]

where the first term is parallel to \(\mathbf{u}\) and the second term
is orthogonal. This decomposition underlies methods such as least
squares approximation and the Gram--Schmidt process.

\subsubsection{Notation}\label{notation-4}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \(\mathbf{u} \perp \mathbf{v}\): vectors \(\mathbf{u}\) and
  \(\mathbf{v}\) are orthogonal.
\item
  An orthogonal set: vectors pairwise orthogonal.
\item
  An orthonormal set: pairwise orthogonal, each of norm 1.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Why this matters}\label{why-this-matters-3}

Orthogonality gives structure to vector spaces. It provides a way to
separate independent directions cleanly, simplify computations, and
minimize errors in approximations. Many powerful algorithms in numerical
linear algebra and data science (QR decomposition, least squares
regression, PCA) rely on orthogonality.

\subsubsection{Exercises 1.4}\label{exercises-14}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Verify that the vectors \((1,2,2)\) and \((2,0,-1)\) are orthogonal.
\item
  Find the projection of \((3,4)\) onto \((1,1)\).
\item
  Show that any two distinct standard basis vectors in \(\mathbb{R}^n\)
  are orthogonal.
\item
  Decompose \((5,2)\) into components parallel and orthogonal to
  \((2,1)\).
\item
  Prove that if \(\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v}\) are orthogonal and nonzero,
  then \((\mathbf{u}+\mathbf{v})\cdot(\mathbf{u}-\mathbf{v}) = 0\).
\end{enumerate}

\section{Chapter 2. Matrices}\label{chapter-2-matrices}

\subsection{2.1 Definition and
Notation}\label{21-definition-and-notation}

Matrices are the central objects of linear algebra, providing a compact
way to represent and manipulate linear transformations, systems of
equations, and structured data. A matrix is a rectangular array of
numbers arranged in rows and columns.

\subsubsection{Formal Definition}\label{formal-definition}

An \(m \times n\) matrix is an array with \(m\) rows and \(n\) columns,
written

\[A =
\begin{bmatrix}
a_{11} & a_{12} & \cdots & a_{1n} \\
a_{21} & a_{22} & \cdots & a_{2n} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
a_{m1} & a_{m2} & \cdots & a_{mn}
\end{bmatrix}.\]

Each entry \(a_{ij}\) is a scalar, located in the \emph{i}-th row and
\emph{j}-th column. The size (or dimension) of the matrix is denoted by
\(m \times n\).

\begin{itemize}
\item
  If \(m = n\), the matrix is square.
\item
  If \(m = 1\), the matrix is a row vector.
\item
  If \(n = 1\), the matrix is a column vector.
\end{itemize}

Thus, vectors are simply special cases of matrices.

\subsubsection{Examples}\label{examples}

Example 2.1.1. A \(2 \times 3\) matrix:

\[A = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & -2 & 4 \\
0 & 3 & 5
\end{bmatrix}.\]

Here, \(a_{12} = -2\), \(a_{23} = 5\), and the matrix has 2 rows, 3
columns.

Example 2.1.2. A \(3 \times 3\) square matrix:

\[B = \begin{bmatrix}
2 & 0 & 1 \\
-1 & 3 & 4 \\
0 & 5 & -2
\end{bmatrix}.\]

This will later serve as the representation of a linear transformation
on \(\mathbb{R}^3\).

\subsubsection{Indexing and Notation}\label{indexing-and-notation}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Matrices are denoted by uppercase bold letters: \(A, B, C\).
\item
  Entries are written as \(a_{ij}\), with the row index first, column
  index second.
\item
  The set of all real \(m \times n\) matrices is denoted
  \(\mathbb{R}^{m \times n}\).
\end{itemize}

Thus, a matrix is a function
\(A: {1,\dots,m} \times {1,\dots,n} \to \mathbb{R}\), assigning a scalar
to each row-column position.

\subsubsection{Why this matters}\label{why-this-matters-4}

Matrices generalize vectors and give us a language for describing linear
operations systematically. They encode systems of equations, rotations,
projections, and transformations of data. With matrices, algebra and
geometry come together: a single compact object can represent both
numerical data and functional rules.

\subsubsection{Exercises 2.1}\label{exercises-21}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Write a \(3 \times 2\) matrix of your choice and identify its entries
  \(a_{ij}\).
\item
  Is every vector a matrix? Is every matrix a vector? Explain.
\item
  Which of the following are square matrices:
  \(A \in \mathbb{R}^{4\times4}\), \(B \in \mathbb{R}^{3\times5}\),
  \(C \in \mathbb{R}^{1\times1}\)?
\item
  Let \(D = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}\). What kind of
  matrix is this?
\item
  Consider the matrix
  \(E = \begin{bmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{bmatrix}\). Express
  \(e_{11}, e_{12}, e_{21}, e_{22}\) explicitly.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{2.2 Matrix Addition and
Multiplication}\label{22-matrix-addition-and-multiplication}

Once matrices are defined, the next step is to understand how they
combine. Just as vectors gain meaning through addition and scalar
multiplication, matrices become powerful through two operations:
addition and multiplication.

\subsubsection{Matrix Addition}\label{matrix-addition}

Two matrices of the same size are added by adding corresponding entries.
If

\[A = [a_{ij}] \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}, \quad
B = [b_{ij}] \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n},\]

then

\[A + B = [a_{ij} + b_{ij}] \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}.\]

Example 2.2.1.\\
Let

\[A = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 \\
3 & 4
\end{bmatrix}, \quad
B = \begin{bmatrix}
-1 & 0 \\
5 & 2
\end{bmatrix}.\]

Then

\[A + B = \begin{bmatrix}
1 + (-1) & 2 + 0 \\
3 + 5 & 4 + 2
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 2 \\
8 & 6
\end{bmatrix}.\]

Matrix addition is commutative (\(A+B = B+A\)) and associative
(\((A+B)+C = A+(B+C)\)). The zero matrix, with all entries 0, acts as
the additive identity.

\subsubsection{Scalar Multiplication}\label{scalar-multiplication-2}

For a scalar \(c \in \mathbb{R}\) and a matrix \(A = [[a_{ij}]\), we
define

\[cA = [c \cdot a_{ij}].\]

This stretches or shrinks all entries of the matrix uniformly.

Example 2.2.2.\\
If

\[A = \begin{bmatrix}
2 & -1 \\
0 & 3
\end{bmatrix}, \quad c = -2,\]

then

\[cA = \begin{bmatrix}
-4 & 2 \\
0 & -6
\end{bmatrix}.\]

\subsubsection{Matrix Multiplication}\label{matrix-multiplication}

The defining operation of matrices is multiplication. If

\[A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}, \quad B \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times p},\]

then their product is the \(m \times p\) matrix

\[AB = C = [c_{ij}], \quad c_{ij} = \sum_{k=1}^n a_{ik} b_{kj}.\]

Thus, the entry in the \(i\)-th row and \(j\)-th column of \(AB\) is the
dot product of the \(i\)-th row of \(A\) with the \(j\)-th column of
\(B\).

Example 2.2.3.\\
Let

\[A = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 \\
0 & 3
\end{bmatrix}, \quad
B = \begin{bmatrix}
4 & -1 \\
2 & 5
\end{bmatrix}.\]

Then

\[AB = \begin{bmatrix}
1\cdot4 + 2\cdot2 & 1\cdot(-1) + 2\cdot5 \\
0\cdot4 + 3\cdot2 & 0\cdot(-1) + 3\cdot5
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
8 & 9 \\
6 & 15
\end{bmatrix}.\]

Notice that matrix multiplication is not commutative in general:
\(AB \neq BA\). Sometimes \(BA\) may not even be defined if dimensions
do not align.

\subsubsection{Geometric Meaning}\label{geometric-meaning}

Matrix multiplication corresponds to the composition of linear
transformations. If \(A\) transforms vectors in \(\mathbb{R}^n\) and
\(B\) transforms vectors in \(\mathbb{R}^p\), then \(AB\) represents
applying \(B\) first, then \(A\). This makes matrices the algebraic
language of transformations.

\subsubsection{Notation}\label{notation-5}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Matrix sum: \(A+B\).
\item
  Scalar multiple: \(cA\).
\item
  Product: \(AB\), defined only when the number of columns of \(A\)
  equals the number of rows of \(B\).
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Why this matters}\label{why-this-matters-5}

Matrix multiplication is the core mechanism of linear algebra: it
encodes how transformations combine, how systems of equations are
solved, and how data flows in modern algorithms. Addition and scalar
multiplication make matrices into a vector space, while multiplication
gives them an algebraic structure rich enough to model geometry,
computation, and networks.

\subsubsection{Exercises 2.2}\label{exercises-22}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Compute \(A+B\) for
\end{enumerate}

\[A = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ -1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad
B = \begin{bmatrix} 4 & -2 \\ 5 & 7 \end{bmatrix}.\]

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Find \(3A\) where
\end{enumerate}

\[A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & -4 \\ 2 & 6 \end{bmatrix}.\]

\begin{enumerate}

\item
  Multiply
\end{enumerate}

\[A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 2 \\ -1 & 3 & 1 \end{bmatrix}, \quad
B = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & 1 \\ 0 & -1 \\ 3 & 4 \end{bmatrix}.\]

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Verify with an explicit example that \(AB \neq BA\).
\item
  Prove that matrix multiplication is distributive:
  \(A(B+C) = AB + AC\).
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{2.3 Transpose and Inverse}\label{23-transpose-and-inverse}

Two special operations on matrices-the transpose and the inverse-give
rise to deep algebraic and geometric properties. The transpose
rearranges a matrix by flipping it across its main diagonal, while the
inverse, when it exists, acts as the undo operation for matrix
multiplication.

\subsubsection{The Transpose}\label{the-transpose}

The transpose of an \(m \times n\) matrix \(A = [a_{ij}]\) is the
\(n \times m\) matrix \(A^T = [a_{ji}]\), obtained by swapping rows and
columns.

Formally,

\[(A^T)_{ij} = a_{ji}.\]

Example 2.3.1.\\
If

\[A = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 4 & -2 \\
0 & 3 & 5
\end{bmatrix},\]

then

\[A^T = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 \\
4 & 3 \\
-2 & 5
\end{bmatrix}.\]

Properties of the Transpose.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \( (A^T)^T = A\).
\item
  \( (A+B)^T = A^T + B^T\).
\item
  \( (cA)^T = cA^T\), for scalar \(c\).
\item
  \( (AB)^T = B^T A^T\).
\end{enumerate}

The last rule is crucial: the order reverses.

\subsubsection{The Inverse}\label{the-inverse}

A square matrix \(A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}\) is said to be
invertible (or nonsingular) if there exists another matrix \(A^{-1}\)
such that

\[AA^{-1} = A^{-1}A = I_n,\]

where \(I_n\) is the \(n \times n\) identity matrix. In this case,
\(A^{-1}\) is called the inverse of \(A\).

Not every matrix is invertible. A necessary condition is that
\(\det(A) \neq 0\), a fact that will be developed in Chapter 6.

Example 2.3.2.\\
Let

\[A = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 \\
3 & 4
\end{bmatrix}.\]

Its determinant is \(\det(A) = (1)(4) - (2)(3) = -2 \neq 0\). The
inverse is

\[A^{-1} = \frac{1}{\det(A)} \begin{bmatrix}
4 & -2 \\
-3 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
-2 & 1 \\
1.5 & -0.5
\end{bmatrix}.\]

Verification:

\[AA^{-1} = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 \\
3 & 4
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
-2 & 1 \\
1.5 & -0.5
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 \\
0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}.\]

\subsubsection{Geometric Meaning}\label{geometric-meaning-2}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The transpose corresponds to reflecting a linear transformation across
  the diagonal. For vectors, it switches between row and column forms.
\item
  The inverse, when it exists, corresponds to reversing a linear
  transformation. For example, if \(A\) scales and rotates vectors,
  \(A^{-1}\) rescales and rotates them back.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Notation}\label{notation-6}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Transpose: \(A^T\).
\item
  Inverse: \(A^{-1}\), defined only for invertible square matrices.
\item
  Identity: \(I_n\), acts as the multiplicative identity.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Why this matters}\label{why-this-matters-6}

The transpose allows us to define symmetric and orthogonal matrices,
central to geometry and numerical methods. The inverse underlies the
solution of linear systems, encoding the idea of undoing a
transformation. Together, these operations set the stage for
determinants, eigenvalues, and orthogonalization.

\subsubsection{Exercises 2.3}\label{exercises-23}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Compute the transpose of
\end{enumerate}

\[A = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & -1 & 3 \\ 0 & 4 & 5 \end{bmatrix}.\]

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Verify that \((AB)^T = B^T A^T\) for
\end{enumerate}

\[A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}, \quad
B = \begin{bmatrix} 3 & 4 \\ 5 & 6 \end{bmatrix}.\]

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Determine whether
\end{enumerate}

\[C = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & 1 \\ 4 & 2 \end{bmatrix}\]

is invertible. If so, find \(C^{-1}\).

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Find the inverse of
\end{enumerate}

\[D = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ -1 & 0 \end{bmatrix},\]

and explain its geometric action on vectors in the plane.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Prove that if \(A\) is invertible, then so is \(A^T\), and
  \((A^T)^{-1} = (A^{-1})^T\).
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{2.4 Special Matrices}\label{24-special-matrices}

Certain matrices occur so frequently in theory and applications that
they are given special names. Recognizing their properties allows us to
simplify computations and understand the structure of linear
transformations more clearly.

\subsubsection{The Identity Matrix}\label{the-identity-matrix}

The identity matrix \(I_n\) is the \(n \times n\) matrix with ones on
the diagonal and zeros elsewhere:

\[I_n = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & \cdots & 0 \\
0 & 1 & \cdots & 0 \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
0 & 0 & \cdots & 1
\end{bmatrix}.\]

It acts as the multiplicative identity:

\[AI_n = I_nA = A, \quad \text{for all } A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}.\]

Geometrically, \(I_n\) represents the transformation that leaves every
vector unchanged.

\subsubsection{Diagonal Matrices}\label{diagonal-matrices}

A diagonal matrix has all off-diagonal entries zero:

\[D = \begin{bmatrix}
d_{11} & 0 & \cdots & 0 \\
0 & d_{22} & \cdots & 0 \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
0 & 0 & \cdots & d_{nn}
\end{bmatrix}.\]

Multiplication by a diagonal matrix scales each coordinate
independently:

\[D\mathbf{x} = (d_{11}x_1, d_{22}x_2, \dots, d_{nn}x_n).\]

Example 2.4.1.\\
Let

\[D = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 3 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}, \quad 
\mathbf{x} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 4 \\ -2 \end{bmatrix}.\]

Then

\[D\mathbf{x} = \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 12 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix}.\]

\subsubsection{Permutation Matrices}\label{permutation-matrices}

A permutation matrix is obtained by permuting the rows of the identity
matrix. Multiplying a vector by a permutation matrix reorders its
coordinates.

Example 2.4.2.\\
Let

\[P = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & 1 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}.\]

Then

\[P\begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \\ c \end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix} b \\ a \\ c \end{bmatrix}.\]

Thus, \(P\) swaps the first two coordinates.

Permutation matrices are always invertible; their inverses are simply
their transposes.

\subsubsection{Symmetric and Skew-Symmetric
Matrices}\label{symmetric-and-skew-symmetric-matrices}

A matrix is symmetric if

\[A^T = A,\]

and skew-symmetric if

\[A^T = -A.\]

Symmetric matrices appear in quadratic forms and optimization, while
skew-symmetric matrices describe rotations and cross products in
geometry.

\subsubsection{Orthogonal Matrices}\label{orthogonal-matrices}

A square matrix \(Q\) is orthogonal if

\[Q^T Q = QQ^T = I.\]

Equivalently, the rows (and columns) of \(Q\) form an orthonormal set.
Orthogonal matrices preserve lengths and angles; they represent
rotations and reflections.

Example 2.4.3.\\
The rotation matrix in the plane:

\[R(\theta) = \begin{bmatrix}
\cos\theta & -\sin\theta \\
\sin\theta & \cos\theta
\end{bmatrix}\]

is orthogonal, since

\[R(\theta)^T R(\theta) = I_2.\]

\subsubsection{Why this matters}\label{why-this-matters-7}

Special matrices serve as the building blocks of linear algebra.
Identity matrices define the neutral element, diagonal matrices simplify
computations, permutation matrices reorder data, symmetric and
orthogonal matrices describe fundamental geometric structures. Much of
modern applied mathematics reduces complex problems to operations
involving these simple forms.

\subsubsection{Exercises 2.4}\label{exercises-24}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Show that the product of two diagonal matrices is diagonal, and
  compute an example.
\item
  Find the permutation matrix that cycles \((a,b,c)\) into \((b,c,a)\).
\item
  Prove that every permutation matrix is invertible and its inverse is
  its transpose.
\item
  Verify that
\end{enumerate}

\[Q = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ -1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}\]

is orthogonal. What geometric transformation does it represent?\\
5. Determine whether

\[A = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 3 & 2 \end{bmatrix}, \quad
B = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 5 \\ -5 & 0 \end{bmatrix}\]

are symmetric, skew-symmetric, or neither.

\section{Chapter 3. Systems of Linear
Equations}\label{chapter-3-systems-of-linear-equations}

\subsection{3.1 Linear Systems and
Solutions}\label{31-linear-systems-and-solutions}

One of the central motivations for linear algebra is solving systems of
linear equations. These systems arise naturally in science, engineering,
and data analysis whenever multiple constraints interact. Matrices
provide a compact language for expressing and solving them.

\subsubsection{Linear Systems}\label{linear-systems}

A linear system consists of equations where each unknown appears only to
the first power and with no products between variables. A general system
of \(m\) equations in \(n\) unknowns can be written as:

\begin{aligned}
a_{11}x_1 + a_{12}x_2 + \cdots + a_{1n}x_n &= b_1, \\
a_{21}x_1 + a_{22}x_2 + \cdots + a_{2n}x_n &= b_2, \\
&\vdots \\
a_{m1}x_1 + a_{m2}x_2 + \cdots + a_{mn}x_n &= b_m.
\end{aligned}

Here the coefficients \(a_{ij}\) and constants \(b_i\) are scalars, and
the unknowns are \(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n\).

\subsubsection{Matrix Form}\label{matrix-form}

The system can be expressed compactly as:

\[A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b},\]

where

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \(A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}\) is the coefficient matrix
  \([a_{ij}]\),
\item
  \(\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n\) is the column vector of unknowns,
\item
  \(\mathbf{b} \in \mathbb{R}^m\) is the column vector of constants.
\end{itemize}

This formulation turns the problem of solving equations into analyzing
the action of a matrix.

Example 3.1.1.\\
The system

\begin{cases}
x + 2y = 5, \\
3x - y = 4
\end{cases}

can be written as

\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 3 & -1 \end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix} 5 \\ 4 \end{bmatrix}.

\subsubsection{Types of Solutions}\label{types-of-solutions}

A linear system may have:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  No solution (inconsistent): The equations conflict.\\
  Example:\\
  \(
  \begin{cases}
  x + y = 1 \\
  x + y = 2
  \end{cases}
  \)\\
  has no solution.
\item
  Exactly one solution (unique): The system's equations intersect at a
  single point.\\
  Example: The above system with coefficient matrix \(
  \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 3 & -1 \end{bmatrix}
  \) has a unique solution.
\item
  Infinitely many solutions: The equations describe overlapping
  constraints (e.g., multiple equations representing the same line or
  plane).
\end{enumerate}

The nature of the solution depends on the rank of \(A\) and its relation
to the augmented matrix \((A|\mathbf{b})\), which we will study later.

\subsubsection{Geometric
Interpretation}\label{geometric-interpretation-2}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  In \(\mathbb{R}^2\), each linear equation represents a line. Solving a
  system means finding intersection points of lines.
\item
  In \(\mathbb{R}^3\), each equation represents a plane. A system may
  have no solution (parallel planes), one solution (a unique
  intersection point), or infinitely many (a line of intersection).
\item
  In higher dimensions, the picture generalizes: solutions form
  intersections of hyperplanes.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Why this matters}\label{why-this-matters-8}

Linear systems are the practical foundation of linear algebra. They
appear in balancing chemical reactions, circuit analysis, least-squares
regression, optimization, and computer graphics. Understanding how to
represent and classify their solutions is the first step toward
systematic solution methods like Gaussian elimination.

\subsubsection{Exercises 3.1}\label{exercises-31}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Write the following system in matrix form:\\
  \(
  \begin{cases}
  2x + 3y - z = 7, \\
  x - y + 4z = 1, \\
  3x + 2y + z = 5
  \end{cases}
  \)
\item
  Determine whether the system\\
  \(
  \begin{cases}
  x + y = 1, \\
  2x + 2y = 2
  \end{cases}
  \)\\
  has no solution, one solution, or infinitely many solutions.
\item
  Geometrically interpret the system\\
  \(
  \begin{cases}
  x + y = 3, \\
  x - y = 1
  \end{cases}
  \)\\
  in the plane.
\item
  Solve the system\\
  \(
  \begin{cases}
  2x + y = 1, \\
  x - y = 4
  \end{cases}
  \)\\
  and check your solution.
\item
  In \(\mathbb{R}^3\), describe the solution set of\\
  \(
  \begin{cases}
  x + y + z = 0, \\
  2x + 2y + 2z = 0
  \end{cases}
  \).\\
  What geometric object does it represent?
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{3.2 Gaussian Elimination}\label{32-gaussian-elimination}

To solve linear systems efficiently, we use Gaussian elimination: a
systematic method of transforming a system into a simpler equivalent one
whose solutions are easier to see. The method relies on elementary row
operations that preserve the solution set.

\subsubsection{Elementary Row
Operations}\label{elementary-row-operations}

On an augmented matrix \((A|\mathbf{b})\), we are allowed three
operations:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Row swapping: interchange two rows.
\item
  Row scaling: multiply a row by a nonzero scalar.
\item
  Row replacement: replace one row by itself plus a multiple of another
  row.
\end{enumerate}

These operations correspond to re-expressing equations in different but
equivalent forms.

\subsubsection{Row Echelon Form}\label{row-echelon-form}

A matrix is in row echelon form (REF) if:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  All nonzero rows are above any zero rows.
\item
  Each leading entry (the first nonzero number from the left in a row)
  is to the right of the leading entry in the row above.
\item
  All entries below a leading entry are zero.
\end{enumerate}

Further, if each leading entry is 1 and is the only nonzero entry in its
column, the matrix is in reduced row echelon form (RREF).

\subsubsection{Algorithm of Gaussian
Elimination}\label{algorithm-of-gaussian-elimination}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Write the augmented matrix for the system.
\item
  Use row operations to create zeros below each pivot (the leading entry
  in a row).
\item
  Continue column by column until the matrix is in echelon form.
\item
  Solve by back substitution: starting from the last pivot equation and
  working upward.
\end{enumerate}

If we continue to RREF, the solution can be read off directly.

\subsubsection{Example}\label{example}

Example 3.2.1. Solve

\begin{cases}
x + 2y - z = 3, \\
2x + y + z = 7, \\
3x - y + 2z = 4.
\end{cases}

Step 1. Augmented matrix

\[\left[\begin{array}{ccc|c}
1 & 2 & -1 & 3 \\
2 & 1 & 1 & 7 \\
3 & -1 & 2 & 4
\end{array}\right].\]

Step 2. Eliminate below the first pivot

Subtract 2 times row 1 from row 2, and 3 times row 1 from row 3:

\[\left[\begin{array}{ccc|c}
1 & 2 & -1 & 3 \\
0 & -3 & 3 & 1 \\
0 & -7 & 5 & -5
\end{array}\right].\]

Step 3. Pivot in column 2

Divide row 2 by -3:

\[\left[\begin{array}{ccc|c}
1 & 2 & -1 & 3 \\
0 & 1 & -1 & -\tfrac{1}{3} \\
0 & -7 & 5 & -5
\end{array}\right].\]

Add 7 times row 2 to row 3:

\[\left[\begin{array}{ccc|c}
1 & 2 & -1 & 3 \\
0 & 1 & -1 & -\tfrac{1}{3} \\
0 & 0 & -2 & -\tfrac{22}{3}
\end{array}\right].\]

Step 4. Pivot in column 3

Divide row 3 by -2:

\[\left[\begin{array}{ccc|c}
1 & 2 & -1 & 3 \\
0 & 1 & -1 & -\tfrac{1}{3} \\
0 & 0 & 1 & \tfrac{11}{3}
\end{array}\right].\]

Step 5. Back substitution

From the last row:\\
\(
z = \tfrac{11}{3}.
\)

Second row:\\
\(
y - z = -\tfrac{1}{3} \implies y = -\tfrac{1}{3} + \tfrac{11}{3} = \tfrac{10}{3}.
\)

First row:\\
\(
x + 2y - z = 3 \implies x + 2\cdot\tfrac{10}{3} - \tfrac{11}{3} = 3.
\)

So\\
\(
x + \tfrac{20}{3} - \tfrac{11}{3} = 3 \implies x + 3 = 3 \implies x = 0.
\)

Solution:\\
\(
(x,y,z) = \big(0, \tfrac{10}{3}, \tfrac{11}{3}\big).
\)

\subsubsection{Why this matters}\label{why-this-matters-9}

Gaussian elimination is the foundation of computational linear algebra.
It reduces complex systems to a form where solutions are visible, and it
forms the basis for algorithms used in numerical analysis, scientific
computing, and machine learning.

\subsubsection{Exercises 3.2}\label{exercises-32}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Solve by Gaussian elimination:\\
  \(
  \begin{cases}
  x + y = 2, \\
  2x - y = 0.
  \end{cases}
  \)
\item
  Reduce the following augmented matrix to REF:\\
  \(
  \left[\begin{array}{ccc|c}
  1 & 1 & 1 & 6 \\
  2 & -1 & 3 & 14 \\
  1 & 4 & -2 & -2
  \end{array}\right].
  \)
\item
  Show that Gaussian elimination always produces either:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    a unique solution,
  \item
    infinitely many solutions, or
  \item
    a contradiction (no solution).
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Use Gaussian elimination to find all solutions of\\
  \(
  \begin{cases}
  x + y + z = 0, \\
  2x + y + z = 1.
  \end{cases}
  \)
\item
  Explain why pivoting (choosing the largest available pivot element) is
  useful in numerical computation.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{3.3 Rank and Consistency}\label{33-rank-and-consistency}

Gaussian elimination not only provides solutions but also reveals the
structure of a linear system. Two key ideas are the rank of a matrix and
the consistency of a system. Rank measures the amount of independent
information in the equations, while consistency determines whether the
system has at least one solution.

\subsubsection{Rank of a Matrix}\label{rank-of-a-matrix}

The rank of a matrix is the number of leading pivots in its row echelon
form. Equivalently, it is the maximum number of linearly independent
rows or columns.

Formally,

\[\text{rank}(A) = \dim(\text{row space of } A) = \dim(\text{column space of } A).\]

The rank tells us the effective dimension of the space spanned by the
rows (or columns).

Example 3.3.1.\\
For

\[A = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3 \\
2 & 4 & 6 \\
3 & 6 & 9
\end{bmatrix},\]

row reduction gives

\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3 \\
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0
\end{bmatrix}.

Thus, \(\text{rank}(A) = 1\), since all rows are multiples of the first.

\subsubsection{Consistency of Linear
Systems}\label{consistency-of-linear-systems}

Consider the system \(A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}\).\\
The system is consistent (has at least one solution) if and only if

\[\text{rank}(A) = \text{rank}(A|\mathbf{b}),\]

where \((A|\mathbf{b})\) is the augmented matrix.\\
If the ranks differ, the system is inconsistent.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  If \(\text{rank}(A) = \text{rank}(A|\mathbf{b}) = n\) (number of
  unknowns), the system has a unique solution.
\item
  If \(\text{rank}(A) = \text{rank}(A|\mathbf{b}) < n\), the system has
  infinitely many solutions.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Example}\label{example-2}

Example 3.3.2.\\
Consider

\begin{cases}
x + y + z = 1, \\
2x + 2y + 2z = 2, \\
x + y + z = 3.
\end{cases}

The augmented matrix is

\[\left[\begin{array}{ccc|c}
1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
2 & 2 & 2 & 2 \\
1 & 1 & 1 & 3
\end{array}\right].\]

Row reduction gives

\[\left[\begin{array}{ccc|c}
1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 2
\end{array}\right].\]

Here, \(\text{rank}(A) = 1\), but \(\text{rank}(A|\mathbf{b}) = 2\).
Since the ranks differ, the system is inconsistent: no solution exists.

\subsubsection{Example with Infinite
Solutions}\label{example-with-infinite-solutions}

Example 3.3.3.\\
For

\begin{cases}
x + y = 2, \\
2x + 2y = 4,
\end{cases}

the augmented matrix reduces to

\[\left[\begin{array}{cc|c}
1 & 1 & 2 \\
0 & 0 & 0
\end{array}\right].\]

Here, \(\text{rank}(A) = \text{rank}(A|\mathbf{b}) = 1 < 2\). Thus,
infinitely many solutions exist, forming a line.

\subsubsection{Why this matters}\label{why-this-matters-10}

Rank is a measure of independence: it tells us how many truly distinct
equations or directions are present. Consistency explains when equations
align versus when they contradict. These concepts connect linear systems
to vector spaces and prepare for the ideas of dimension, basis, and the
Rank--Nullity Theorem.

\subsubsection{Exercises 3.3}\label{exercises-33}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Compute the rank of
\end{enumerate}

\[A = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 & 1 \\
0 & 1 & -1 \\
2 & 5 & -1
\end{bmatrix}.\]

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Determine whether the system
\end{enumerate}

\begin{cases}
x + y + z = 1, \\
2x + 3y + z = 2, \\
3x + 5y + 2z = 3
\end{cases}

is consistent.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Show that the rank of the identity matrix \(I_n\) is \(n\).
\item
  Give an example of a system in \(\mathbb{R}^3\) with infinitely many
  solutions, and explain why it satisfies the rank condition.
\item
  Prove that for any matrix \(A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}\),\\
  \(
  \text{rank}(A) \leq \min(m,n).
  \)
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{3.4 Homogeneous Systems}\label{34-homogeneous-systems}

A homogeneous system is a linear system in which all constant terms are
zero:

\[A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0},\]

where \(A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}\), and \(\mathbf{0}\) is the zero
vector in \(\mathbb{R}^m\).

\subsubsection{The Trivial Solution}\label{the-trivial-solution}

Every homogeneous system has at least one solution:

\[\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0}.\]

This is called the trivial solution. The interesting question is whether
\emph{nontrivial solutions} (nonzero vectors) exist.

\subsubsection{Existence of Nontrivial
Solutions}\label{existence-of-nontrivial-solutions}

Nontrivial solutions exist precisely when the number of unknowns exceeds
the rank of the coefficient matrix:

\[\text{rank}(A) < n.\]

In this case, there are infinitely many solutions, forming a subspace of
\(\mathbb{R}^n\). The dimension of this solution space is

\[\dim(\text{null}(A)) = n - \text{rank}(A),\]

where null(A) is the set of all solutions to \(A\mathbf{x} = 0\). This
set is called the null space or kernel of \(A\).

\subsubsection{Example}\label{example-3}

Example 3.4.1.\\
Consider

\begin{cases}
x + y + z = 0, \\
2x + y - z = 0.
\end{cases}

The augmented matrix is

\[\left[\begin{array}{ccc|c}
1 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\
2 & 1 & -1 & 0
\end{array}\right].\]

Row reduction:

\[\left[\begin{array}{ccc|c}
1 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & -1 & -3 & 0
\end{array}\right]
\quad\to\quad
\left[\begin{array}{ccc|c}
1 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 3 & 0
\end{array}\right].\]

So the system is equivalent to:

\begin{cases}
x + y + z = 0, \\
y + 3z = 0.
\end{cases}

From the second equation, \(y = -3z\). Substituting into the first:\\
\(
x - 3z + z = 0 \implies x = 2z.
\)

Thus solutions are:

\[(x,y,z) = z(2, -3, 1), \quad z \in \mathbb{R}.\]

The null space is the line spanned by the vector \((2, -3, 1)\).

\subsubsection{Geometric
Interpretation}\label{geometric-interpretation-3}

The solution set of a homogeneous system is always a subspace of
\(\mathbb{R}^n\).

\begin{itemize}
\item
  If \(\text{rank}(A) = n\), the only solution is the zero vector.
\item
  If \(\text{rank}(A) = n-1\), the solution set is a line through the
  origin.
\item
  If \(\text{rank}(A) = n-2\), the solution set is a plane through the
  origin.
\end{itemize}

More generally, the null space has dimension \(n - \text{rank}(A)\),
known as the nullity.

\subsubsection{Why this matters}\label{why-this-matters-11}

Homogeneous systems are central to understanding vector spaces,
subspaces, and dimension. They lead directly to the concepts of kernel,
null space, and linear dependence. In applications, homogeneous systems
appear in equilibrium problems, eigenvalue equations, and computer
graphics transformations.

\subsubsection{Exercises 3.4}\label{exercises-34}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Solve the homogeneous system
\end{enumerate}

\begin{cases}
x + 2y - z = 0, \\
2x + 4y - 2z = 0.
\end{cases}

What is the dimension of its solution space?

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Find all solutions of
\end{enumerate}

\begin{cases}
x - y + z = 0, \\
2x + y - z = 0.
\end{cases}

\begin{enumerate}

\item
  Show that the solution set of any homogeneous system is a subspace of
  \(\mathbb{R}^n\).
\item
  Suppose \(A\) is a \(3 \times 3\) matrix with \(\text{rank}(A) = 2\).
  What is the dimension of the null space of \(A\)?
\item
  For
\end{enumerate}

\[A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & -1 \\ 0 & 1 & 3 \end{bmatrix},\]

compute a basis for the null space of \(A\).

\section{Chapter 4. Vector Spaces}\label{chapter-4-vector-spaces}

\subsection{4.1 Definition of a Vector
Space}\label{41-definition-of-a-vector-space}

Up to now we have studied vectors and matrices concretely in
\(\mathbb{R}^n\). The next step is to move beyond coordinates and define
vector spaces in full generality. A vector space is an abstract setting
where the familiar rules of addition and scalar multiplication hold,
regardless of whether the elements are geometric vectors, polynomials,
functions, or other objects.

\subsubsection{Formal Definition}\label{formal-definition-2}

A vector space over the real numbers \(\mathbb{R}\) is a set \(V\)
equipped with two operations:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Vector addition: For any \(\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v} \in V\), there is a
  vector \(\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v} \in V\).
\item
  Scalar multiplication: For any scalar \(c \in \mathbb{R}\) and any
  \(\mathbf{v} \in V\), there is a vector \(c\mathbf{v} \in V\).
\end{enumerate}

These operations must satisfy the following axioms (for all
\(\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v}, \mathbf{w} \in V\) and all scalars
\(a,b \in \mathbb{R}\)):

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Commutativity of addition:
  \(\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v} = \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{u}\).
\item
  Associativity of addition:
  \((\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}) + \mathbf{w} = \mathbf{u} + (\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w})\).
\item
  Additive identity: There exists a zero vector \(\mathbf{0} \in V\)
  such that \(\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{0} = \mathbf{v}\).
\item
  Additive inverses: For each \(\mathbf{v} \in V\), there exists
  \((-\mathbf{v} \in V\) such that
  \(\mathbf{v} + (-\mathbf{v}) = \mathbf{0}\).
\item
  Compatibility of scalar multiplication:
  \(a(b\mathbf{v}) = (ab)\mathbf{v}\).
\item
  Identity element of scalars: \(1 \cdot \mathbf{v} = \mathbf{v}\).
\item
  Distributivity over vector addition:
  \(a(\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}) = a\mathbf{u} + a\mathbf{v}\).
\item
  Distributivity over scalar addition:
  \((a+b)\mathbf{v} = a\mathbf{v} + b\mathbf{v}\).
\end{enumerate}

If a set \(V\) with operations satisfies all eight axioms, we call it a
vector space.

\subsubsection{Examples}\label{examples-2}

Example 4.1.1. Standard Euclidean space\\
\(\mathbb{R}^n\) with ordinary addition and scalar multiplication is a
vector space. This is the model case from which the axioms are
abstracted.

Example 4.1.2. Polynomials\\
The set of all polynomials with real coefficients, denoted
\(\mathbb{R}[x]\), forms a vector space. Addition and scalar
multiplication are defined term by term.

Example 4.1.3. Functions\\
The set of all real-valued functions on an interval, e.g.
\(f: [0,1] \to \mathbb{R}\), forms a vector space, since functions can
be added and scaled pointwise.

\subsubsection{Non-Examples}\label{non-examples}

Not every set with operations qualifies. For instance, the set of
positive real numbers under usual addition is not a vector space,
because additive inverses (negative numbers) are missing. The axioms
must all hold.

\subsubsection{Geometric
Interpretation}\label{geometric-interpretation-4}

In familiar cases like \(\mathbb{R}^2\) or \(\mathbb{R}^3\), vector
spaces provide the stage for geometry: vectors can be added, scaled, and
combined to form lines, planes, and higher-dimensional structures. In
abstract settings like function spaces, the same algebraic rules let us
apply geometric intuition to infinite-dimensional problems.

\subsubsection{Why this matters}\label{why-this-matters-12}

The concept of vector space unifies seemingly different mathematical
objects under a single framework. Whether dealing with forces in
physics, signals in engineering, or data in machine learning, the common
language of vector spaces allows us to use the same techniques
everywhere.

\subsubsection{Exercises 4.1}\label{exercises-41}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Verify that \(\mathbb{R}^2\) with standard addition and scalar
  multiplication satisfies all eight vector space axioms.
\item
  Show that the set of integers \(\mathbb{Z}\) with ordinary operations
  is not a vector space over \(\mathbb{R}\). Which axiom fails?
\item
  Consider the set of all polynomials of degree at most 3. Show it forms
  a vector space over \(\mathbb{R}\). What is its dimension?
\item
  Give an example of a vector space where the vectors are not geometric
  objects.
\item
  Prove that in any vector space, the zero vector is unique.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{4.2 Subspaces}\label{42-subspaces}

A subspace is a smaller vector space living inside a larger one. Just as
lines and planes naturally sit inside three-dimensional space, subspaces
generalize these ideas to higher dimensions and more abstract settings.

\subsubsection{Definition}\label{definition-2}

Let \(V\) be a vector space. A subset \(W \subseteq V\) is called a
subspace of \(V\) if:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \(\mathbf{0} \in W\) (contains the zero vector),
\item
  For all \(\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v} \in W\), the sum
  \(\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v} \in W\) (closed under addition),
\item
  For all scalars \(c \in \mathbb{R}\) and vectors \(\mathbf{v} \in W\),
  the product \(c\mathbf{v} \in W\) (closed under scalar
  multiplication).
\end{enumerate}

If these hold, then \(W\) is itself a vector space with the inherited
operations.

\subsubsection{Examples}\label{examples-3}

Example 4.2.1. Line through the origin in \(\mathbb{R}^2\)\\
The set

\[W = \{ (t, 2t) \mid t \in \mathbb{R} \}\]

is a subspace of \(\mathbb{R}^2\). It contains the zero vector, is
closed under addition, and is closed under scalar multiplication.

Example 4.2.2. The x--y plane in \(\mathbb{R}^3\)\\
The set

\[W = \{ (x, y, 0) \mid x,y \in \mathbb{R} \}\]

is a subspace of \(\mathbb{R}^3\). It is the collection of all vectors
lying in the plane through the origin parallel to the x--y plane.

Example 4.2.3. Null space of a matrix\\
For a matrix \(A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}\), the null space

\[\{ \mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n \mid A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0} \}\]

is a subspace of \(\mathbb{R}^n\). This subspace represents all
solutions to the homogeneous system.

\subsubsection{Non-Examples}\label{non-examples-2}

Not every subset is a subspace.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The set \({ (x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^2 \mid x \geq 0 }\) is not a
  subspace: it is not closed under scalar multiplication (a negative
  scalar breaks the condition).
\item
  Any line in \(\mathbb{R}^2\) that does not pass through the origin is
  not a subspace, because it does not contain \(\mathbf{0}\).
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Geometric
Interpretation}\label{geometric-interpretation-5}

Subspaces are the linear structures inside vector spaces.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  In \(\mathbb{R}^2\), the subspaces are: the zero vector, any line
  through the origin, or the entire plane.
\item
  In \(\mathbb{R}^3\), the subspaces are: the zero vector, any line
  through the origin, any plane through the origin, or the entire space.
\item
  In higher dimensions, the same principle applies: subspaces are the
  flat linear pieces through the origin.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Why this matters}\label{why-this-matters-13}

Subspaces capture the essential structure of linear problems. Column
spaces, row spaces, and null spaces are all subspaces. Much of linear
algebra consists of understanding how these subspaces intersect, span,
and complement each other.

\subsubsection{Exercises 4.2}\label{exercises-42}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Prove that the set
  \(W = { (x,0) \mid x \in \mathbb{R} } \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2\) is a
  subspace.
\item
  Show that the line \({ (1+t, 2t) \mid t \in \mathbb{R} }\) is not a
  subspace of \(\mathbb{R}^2\). Which condition fails?
\item
  Determine whether the set of all vectors \((x,y,z) \in \mathbb{R}^3\)
  satisfying \(x+y+z=0\) is a subspace.
\item
  For the matrix
\end{enumerate}

\[A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\ 4 & 5 & 6 \end{bmatrix},\]

describe the null space of \(A\) as a subspace of \(\mathbb{R}^3\).\\
5. List all possible subspaces of \(\mathbb{R}^2\).

\subsection{4.3 Span, Basis, Dimension}\label{43-span-basis-dimension}

The ideas of span, basis, and dimension provide the language for
describing the size and structure of subspaces. Together, they tell us
how a vector space is generated, how many building blocks it requires,
and how those blocks can be chosen.

\subsubsection{Span}\label{span}

Given a set of vectors
\({\mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_2, \dots, \mathbf{v}_k} \subseteq V\), the
span is the collection of all linear combinations:

\[\text{span}\{\mathbf{v}_1, \dots, \mathbf{v}_k\} = \{ c_1\mathbf{v}_1 + \cdots + c_k\mathbf{v}_k \mid c_i \in \mathbb{R} \}.\]

The span is always a subspace of \(V\), namely the smallest subspace
containing those vectors.

Example 4.3.1.\\
In \(\mathbb{R}^2\),
\( \text{span}{(1,0)} = \{(x,0) \mid x \in \mathbb{R}\},\) the x-axis.\\
Similarly, \(\text{span}\{(1,0),(0,1)\} = \mathbb{R}^2.\)

\subsubsection{Basis}\label{basis}

A basis of a vector space \(V\) is a set of vectors that:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Span \(V\).
\item
  Are linearly independent (no vector in the set is a linear combination
  of the others).
\end{enumerate}

If either condition fails, the set is not a basis.

Example 4.3.2.\\
In \(\mathbb{R}^3\), the standard unit vectors

\[\mathbf{e}_1 = (1,0,0), \quad \mathbf{e}_2 = (0,1,0), \quad \mathbf{e}_3 = (0,0,1)\]

form a basis. Every vector \((x,y,z)\) can be uniquely written as

\[x\mathbf{e}_1 + y\mathbf{e}_2 + z\mathbf{e}_3.\]

\subsubsection{Dimension}\label{dimension}

The dimension of a vector space \(V\), written \(\dim(V)\), is the
number of vectors in any basis of \(V\). This number is well-defined:
all bases of a vector space have the same cardinality.

Examples 4.3.3.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \(\dim(\mathbb{R}^2) = 2\), with basis \((1,0), (0,1)\).
\item
  \(\dim(\mathbb{R}^3) = 3\), with basis \((1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1)\).
\item
  The set of polynomials of degree at most 3 has dimension 4, with basis
  \((1, x, x^2, x^3)\).
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Geometric
Interpretation}\label{geometric-interpretation-6}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The span is like the reach of a set of vectors.
\item
  A basis is the minimal set of directions needed to reach everything in
  the space.
\item
  The dimension is the count of those independent directions.
\end{itemize}

Lines, planes, and higher-dimensional flats can all be described in
terms of span, basis, and dimension.

\subsubsection{Why this matters}\label{why-this-matters-14}

These concepts classify vector spaces and subspaces in terms of size and
structure. Many theorems in linear algebra-such as the Rank--Nullity
Theorem-are consequences of understanding span, basis, and dimension. In
practical terms, bases are how we encode data in coordinates, and
dimension tells us how much freedom a system truly has.

\subsubsection{Exercises 4.3}\label{exercises-43}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Show that \((1,0,0)\), \((0,1,0)\), \((1,1,0)\) span the \(xy\)-plane
  in \(\mathbb{R}^3\). Are they a basis?
\item
  Find a basis for the line \(\{(2t,-3t,t) : t \in \mathbb{R}\}\) in
  \(\mathbb{R}^3\).
\item
  Determine the dimension of the subspace of \(\mathbb{R}^3\) defined by
  \(x+y+z=0\).
\item
  Prove that any two different bases of \(\mathbb{R}^n\) must contain
  exactly \(n\) vectors.
\item
  Give a basis for the set of polynomials of degree \(\leq 2\). What is
  its dimension?
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{4.4 Coordinates}\label{44-coordinates}

Once a basis for a vector space is chosen, every vector can be expressed
uniquely as a linear combination of the basis vectors. The coefficients
in this combination are called the coordinates of the vector relative to
that basis. Coordinates allow us to move between the abstract world of
vector spaces and the concrete world of numbers.

\subsubsection{Coordinates Relative to a
Basis}\label{coordinates-relative-to-a-basis}

Let \(V\) be a vector space, and let

\[\mathcal{B} = \{\mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_2, \dots, \mathbf{v}_n\}\]

be an ordered basis for \(V\). Every vector \(\mathbf{u} \in V\) can be
written uniquely as

\[\mathbf{u} = c_1 \mathbf{v}_1 + c_2 \mathbf{v}_2 + \cdots + c_n \mathbf{v}_n.\]

The scalars \((c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n)\) are the coordinates of
\(\mathbf{u}\) relative to \(\mathcal{B}\), written

\[[\mathbf{u}]_{\mathcal{B}} = \begin{bmatrix} c_1 \\ c_2 \\ \vdots \\ c_n \end{bmatrix}.\]

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Example in
\(\mathbb{R}^2\)}{Example in \textbackslash mathbb\{R\}\^{}2}}\label{example-in--r-2}

Example 4.4.1.\\
Let the basis be

\[\mathcal{B} = \{ (1,1), (1,-1) \}.\]

To find the coordinates of \(\mathbf{u} = (3,1)\) relative to
\(\mathcal{B}\), solve

\[(3,1) = c_1(1,1) + c_2(1,-1).\]

This gives the system

\begin{cases}
c_1 + c_2 = 3, \\
c_1 - c_2 = 1.
\end{cases}

Adding: \(2c_1 = 4 \implies c_1 = 2\). Then \(c_2 = 1\).

So,

\[[\mathbf{u}]_{\mathcal{B}} = \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.\]

\subsubsection{Standard Coordinates}\label{standard-coordinates}

In \(\mathbb{R}^n\), the standard basis is

\[\mathbf{e}_1 = (1,0,\dots,0), \quad \mathbf{e}_2 = (0,1,0,\dots,0), \dots, \mathbf{e}_n = (0,\dots,0,1).\]

Relative to this basis, the coordinates of a vector are simply its
entries. Thus, column vectors are coordinate representations by default.

\subsubsection{Change of Basis}\label{change-of-basis}

If \(\mathcal{B} = {\mathbf{v}_1, \dots, \mathbf{v}_n}\) is a basis of
\(\mathbb{R}^n\), the change of basis matrix is

\[P = \begin{bmatrix} \mathbf{v}_1 & \mathbf{v}_2 & \cdots & \mathbf{v}_n \end{bmatrix},\]

with basis vectors as columns. For any vector \(\mathbf{u}\),

\[\mathbf{u} = P[\mathbf{u}]_{\mathcal{B}}, \qquad [\mathbf{u}]_{\mathcal{B}} = P^{-1}\mathbf{u}.\]

Thus, switching between bases reduces to matrix multiplication.

\subsubsection{Geometric
Interpretation}\label{geometric-interpretation-7}

Coordinates are the address of a vector relative to a chosen set of
directions. Different bases are like different coordinate systems:
Cartesian, rotated, skewed, or scaled. The same vector may look very
different numerically depending on the basis, but its geometric identity
is unchanged.

\subsubsection{Why this matters}\label{why-this-matters-15}

Coordinates turn abstract vectors into concrete numerical data. Changing
basis is the algebraic language for rotations of axes, diagonalization
of matrices, and principal component analysis in data science. Mastery
of coordinates is essential for moving fluidly between geometry,
algebra, and computation.

\subsubsection{Exercises 4.4}\label{exercises-44}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Express \((4,2)\) in terms of the basis \((1,1), (1,-1)\).
\item
  Find the coordinates of \((1,2,3)\) relative to the standard basis of
  \(\mathbb{R}^3\).
\item
  If \(\mathcal{B} = \{(2,0), (0,3)\}\), compute
  \([ (4,6) ]_{\mathcal{B}}\).
\item
  Construct the change of basis matrix from the standard basis of
  \(\mathbb{R}^2\) to \(\mathcal{B} = \{(1,1), (1,-1)\}\).
\item
  Prove that coordinate representation with respect to a basis is
  unique.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Chapter 5. Linear
Transformations}\label{chapter-5-linear-transformations}

\subsection{5.1 Functions that Preserve
Linearity}\label{51-functions-that-preserve-linearity}

A central theme of linear algebra is understanding linear
transformations: functions between vector spaces that preserve their
algebraic structure. These transformations generalize the idea of matrix
multiplication and capture the essence of linear behavior.

\subsubsection{Definition}\label{definition-3}

Let \(V\) and \(W\) be vector spaces over \(\mathbb{R}\). A function

\[T : V \to W\]

is called a linear transformation (or linear map) if for all vectors
\(\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v} \in V\) and all scalars \(c \in \mathbb{R}\):

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Additivity:

  \[T(\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}) = T(\mathbf{u}) + T(\mathbf{v}),\]
\item
  Homogeneity:

  \[T(c\mathbf{u}) = cT(\mathbf{u}).\]
\end{enumerate}

If both conditions hold, then \(T\) automatically respects linear
combinations:

\[T(c_1\mathbf{v}_1 + \cdots + c_k\mathbf{v}_k) = c_1 T(\mathbf{v}_1) + \cdots + c_k T(\mathbf{v}_k).\]

\subsubsection{Examples}\label{examples-4}

Example 5.1.1. Scaling in \(\mathbb{R}^2\).\\
Let \(T:\mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^2\) be defined by

\[T(x,y) = (2x, 2y).\]

This doubles the length of every vector, preserving direction. It is
linear.

Example 5.1.2. Rotation.\\
Let \(R_\theta: \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^2\) be

\[R_\theta(x,y) = (x\cos\theta - y\sin\theta, \; x\sin\theta + y\cos\theta).\]

This rotates vectors by angle \(\theta\). It satisfies additivity and
homogeneity, hence is linear.

Example 5.1.3. Differentiation.\\
Let \(D: \mathbb{R}[x] \to \mathbb{R}[x]\) be differentiation:
\(D(p(x)) = p'(x)\). Since derivatives respect addition and scalar
multiples, differentiation is a linear transformation.

\subsubsection{Non-Example}\label{non-example}

The map \(S:\mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^2\) defined by

\[S(x,y) = (x^2, y^2)\]

is not linear, because
\(S(\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}) \neq S(\mathbf{u}) + S(\mathbf{v})\) in
general.

\subsubsection{Geometric
Interpretation}\label{geometric-interpretation-8}

Linear transformations are exactly those that preserve the origin, lines
through the origin, and proportions along those lines. They include
familiar operations: scaling, rotations, reflections, shears, and
projections. Nonlinear transformations bend or curve space, breaking
these properties.

\subsubsection{Why this matters}\label{why-this-matters-16}

Linear transformations unify geometry, algebra, and computation. They
explain how matrices act on vectors, how data can be rotated or
projected, and how systems evolve under linear rules. Much of linear
algebra is devoted to understanding these transformations, their
representations, and their invariants.

\subsubsection{Exercises 5.1}\label{exercises-51}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Verify that \(T(x,y) = (3x-y, 2y)\) is a linear transformation on
  \(\mathbb{R}^2\).
\item
  Show that \(T(x,y) = (x+1, y)\) is not linear. Which axiom fails?
\item
  Prove that if \(T\) and \(S\) are linear transformations, then so is
  \(T+S\).
\item
  Give an example of a linear transformation from \(\mathbb{R}^3\) to
  \(\mathbb{R}^2\).
\item
  Let \(T:\mathbb{R}[x] \to \mathbb{R}[x]\) be integration:

  \[T(p(x)) = \int_0^x p(t)\,dt.\]

  Prove that \(T\) is a linear transformation.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{5.2 Matrix Representation of Linear
Maps}\label{52-matrix-representation-of-linear-maps}

Every linear transformation between finite-dimensional vector spaces can
be represented by a matrix. This correspondence is one of the central
insights of linear algebra: it lets us use the tools of matrix
arithmetic to study abstract transformations.

\subsubsection{From Linear Map to
Matrix}\label{from-linear-map-to-matrix}

Let \(T: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m\) be a linear transformation.
Choose the standard basis \(\{ \mathbf{e}_1, \dots, \mathbf{e}_n \}\) of
\(\mathbb{R}^n\), where \(\mathbf{e}_i\) has a 1 in the \(i\)-th
position and 0 elsewhere.

The action of \(T\) on each basis vector determines the entire
transformation:

\[T(\mathbf{e}_j) = \begin{bmatrix} a_{1j} \\ a_{2j} \\ \vdots \\ a_{mj} \end{bmatrix}.\]

Placing these outputs as columns gives the matrix of \(T\):

\[[T] = A = \begin{bmatrix}
a_{11} & a_{12} & \cdots & a_{1n} \\
a_{21} & a_{22} & \cdots & a_{2n} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
a_{m1} & a_{m2} & \cdots & a_{mn}
\end{bmatrix}.\]

Then for any vector \(\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n\):

\[T(\mathbf{x}) = A\mathbf{x}.\]

\subsubsection{Examples}\label{examples-5}

Example 5.2.1. Scaling in \(\mathbb{R}^2\).\\
Let \(T(x,y) = (2x, 3y)\). Then

\[T(\mathbf{e}_1) = (2,0), \quad T(\mathbf{e}_2) = (0,3).\]

So the matrix is

\[[T] = \begin{bmatrix}
2 & 0 \\
0 & 3
\end{bmatrix}.\]

Example 5.2.2. Rotation in the plane.\\
The rotation transformation
\(R_\theta(x,y) = (x\cos\theta - y\sin\theta, \; x\sin\theta + y\cos\theta)\)
has matrix

\[[R_\theta] = \begin{bmatrix}
\cos\theta & -\sin\theta \\
\sin\theta & \cos\theta
\end{bmatrix}.\]

Example 5.2.3. Projection onto the x-axis.\\
The map \(P(x,y) = (x,0)\) corresponds to

\[[P] = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 \\
0 & 0
\end{bmatrix}.\]

\subsubsection{Change of Basis}\label{change-of-basis-2}

Matrix representations depend on the chosen basis. If \(\mathcal{B}\)
and \(\mathcal{C}\) are bases of \(\mathbb{R}^n\) and \(\mathbb{R}^m\),
then the matrix of \(T: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m\) with respect to
these bases is obtained by expressing \(T(\mathbf{v}_j)\) in terms of
\(\mathcal{C}\) for each \(\mathbf{v}_j \in \mathcal{B}\). Changing
bases corresponds to conjugating the matrix by the appropriate
change-of-basis matrices.

\subsubsection{Geometric
Interpretation}\label{geometric-interpretation-9}

Matrices are not just convenient notation-they \emph{are} linear maps
once a basis is fixed. Every rotation, reflection, projection, shear, or
scaling corresponds to multiplying by a specific matrix. Thus, studying
linear transformations reduces to studying their matrices.

\subsubsection{Why this matters}\label{why-this-matters-17}

Matrix representations make linear transformations computable. They
connect abstract definitions to explicit calculations, enabling
algorithms for solving systems, finding eigenvalues, and performing
decompositions. Applications from graphics to machine learning depend on
this translation.

\subsubsection{Exercises 5.2}\label{exercises-52}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Find the matrix representation of \(T:\mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^2\),
  \(T(x,y) = (x+y, x-y)\).
\item
  Determine the matrix of the linear transformation
  \(T:\mathbb{R}^3 \to \mathbb{R}^2\), \(T(x,y,z) = (x+z, y-2z)\).
\item
  What matrix represents reflection across the line \(y=x\) in
  \(\mathbb{R}^2\)?
\item
  Show that the matrix of the identity transformation on
  \(\mathbb{R}^n\) is \(I_n\).
\item
  For the differentiation map \(D:\mathbb{R}_2[x] \to \mathbb{R}_1[x]\),
  where \(\mathbb{R}_k[x]\) is the space of polynomials of degree at
  most \(k\), find the matrix of \(D\) relative to the bases
  \(\{1,x,x^2\}\) and \(\{1,x\}\).
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{5.3 Kernel and Image}\label{53-kernel-and-image}

To understand a linear transformation deeply, we must examine what it
kills and what it produces. These ideas are captured by the kernel and
the image, two fundamental subspaces associated with any linear map.

\subsubsection{The Kernel}\label{the-kernel}

The kernel (or null space) of a linear transformation \(T: V \to W\) is
the set of all vectors in \(V\) that map to the zero vector in \(W\):

\[\ker(T) = \{ \mathbf{v} \in V \mid T(\mathbf{v}) = \mathbf{0} \}.\]

The kernel is always a subspace of \(V\). It measures the degeneracy of
the transformation-directions that collapse to nothing.

Example 5.3.1.\\
Let \(T:\mathbb{R}^3 \to \mathbb{R}^2\) be defined by

\[T(x,y,z) = (x+y, y+z).\]

In matrix form,

\[[T] = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 1
\end{bmatrix}.\]

To find the kernel, solve

\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{bmatrix}
= \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}.

This gives the equations \(x + y = 0\), \(y + z = 0\). Hence
\(x = -y, z = -y\). The kernel is

\[\ker(T) = \{ (-t, t, -t) \mid t \in \mathbb{R} \},\]

a line in \(\mathbb{R}^3\).

\subsubsection{The Image}\label{the-image}

The image (or range) of a linear transformation \(T: V \to W\) is the
set of all outputs:

\[\text{im}(T) = \{ T(\mathbf{v}) \mid \mathbf{v} \in V \} \subseteq W.\]

Equivalently, it is the span of the columns of the representing matrix.
The image is always a subspace of \(W\).

Example 5.3.2.\\
For the same transformation as above,

\[[T] = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 1
\end{bmatrix},\]

the columns are \((1,0)\), \((1,1)\), and \((0,1)\). Since
\((1,1) = (1,0) + (0,1)\), the image is

\[\text{im}(T) = \text{span}\{ (1,0), (0,1) \} = \mathbb{R}^2.\]

\subsubsection{Dimension Formula (Rank--Nullity
Theorem)}\label{dimension-formula-rank--nullity-theorem}

For a linear transformation \(T: V \to W\) with \(V\)
finite-dimensional,

\[\dim(\ker(T)) + \dim(\text{im}(T)) = \dim(V).\]

This fundamental result connects the lost directions (kernel) with the
achieved directions (image).

\subsubsection{Geometric
Interpretation}\label{geometric-interpretation-10}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The kernel describes how the transformation flattens space (e.g.,
  projecting a 3D object onto a plane).
\item
  The image describes the target subspace reached by the transformation.
\item
  The rank--nullity theorem quantifies the tradeoff: the more dimensions
  collapse, the fewer remain in the image.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Why this matters}\label{why-this-matters-18}

Kernel and image capture the essence of a linear map. They classify
transformations, explain when systems have unique or infinite solutions,
and form the backbone of important results like the Rank--Nullity
Theorem, diagonalization, and spectral theory.

\subsubsection{Exercises 5.3}\label{exercises-53}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Find the kernel and image of \(T:\mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^2\),
  \(T(x,y) = (x-y, x+y)\).
\item
  Let \(A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\ 0 & 1 & 4 \end{bmatrix}\). Find
  bases for \(\ker(A)\) and \(\text{im}(A)\).
\item
  For the projection map \(P(x,y,z) = (x,y,0)\), describe the kernel and
  image.
\item
  Prove that \(\ker(T)\) and \(\text{im}(T)\) are always subspaces.
\item
  Verify the Rank--Nullity Theorem for the transformation in Example
  5.3.1.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{5.4 Change of Basis}\label{54-change-of-basis}

Linear transformations can look very different depending on the
coordinate system we use. The process of rewriting vectors and
transformations relative to a new basis is called a change of basis.
This concept lies at the heart of diagonalization, orthogonalization,
and many computational techniques.

\subsubsection{Coordinate Change}\label{coordinate-change}

Suppose \(V\) is an \(n\)-dimensional vector space, and let
\(\mathcal{B} = \{\mathbf{v}_1, \dots, \mathbf{v}_n\}\) be a basis.
Every vector \(\mathbf{x} \in V\) has a coordinate vector
\([\mathbf{x}]_{\mathcal{B}} \in \mathbb{R}^n\).

If \(P\) is the change-of-basis matrix from \(\mathcal{B}\) to the
standard basis, then

\[\mathbf{x} = P [\mathbf{x}]_{\mathcal{B}}.\]

Equivalently,

\[[\mathbf{x}]_{\mathcal{B}} = P^{-1} \mathbf{x}.\]

Here, \(P\) has the basis vectors of \(\mathcal{B}\) as its columns:

\[P = \begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{v}_1 & \mathbf{v}_2 & \cdots & \mathbf{v}_n
\end{bmatrix}.\]

\subsubsection{Transformation of
Matrices}\label{transformation-of-matrices}

Let \(T: V \to V\) be a linear transformation. Suppose its matrix in the
standard basis is \(A\). In the basis \(\mathcal{B}\), the representing
matrix becomes

\[[T]_{\mathcal{B}} = P^{-1} A P.\]

Thus, changing basis corresponds to a similarity transformation of the
matrix.

\subsubsection{Example}\label{example-4}

Example 5.4.1.\\
Let \(T:\mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^2\) be given by

\[T(x,y) = (3x + y, x + y).\]

In the standard basis, its matrix is

\[A = \begin{bmatrix}
3 & 1 \\
1 & 1
\end{bmatrix}.\]

Now consider the basis \(\mathcal{B} = \{ (1,1), (1,-1) \}\). The
change-of-basis matrix is

\[P = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 1 \\
1 & -1
\end{bmatrix}.\]

Then

\[[T]_{\mathcal{B}} = P^{-1} A P.\]

Computing gives

\[[T]_{\mathcal{B}} =
\begin{bmatrix}
4 & 0 \\
0 & 0
\end{bmatrix}.\]

In this new basis, the transformation is diagonal: one direction is
scaled by 4, the other collapsed to 0.

\subsubsection{Geometric
Interpretation}\label{geometric-interpretation-11}

Change of basis is like rotating or skewing your coordinate grid. The
underlying transformation does not change, but its description in
numbers becomes simpler or more complicated depending on the basis.
Finding a basis that simplifies a transformation (often a diagonal
basis) is a key theme in linear algebra.

\subsubsection{Why this matters}\label{why-this-matters-19}

Change of basis connects the abstract notion of similarity to practical
computation. It is the tool that allows us to diagonalize matrices,
compute eigenvalues, and simplify complex transformations. In
applications, it corresponds to choosing a more natural coordinate
system-whether in geometry, physics, or machine learning.

\subsubsection{Exercises 5.4}\label{exercises-54}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Let \(A = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & 1 \\ 0 & 2 \end{bmatrix}\). Compute its
  representation in the basis \(\{(1,0),(1,1)\}\).
\item
  Find the change-of-basis matrix from the standard basis of
  \(\mathbb{R}^2\) to \(\{(2,1),(1,1)\}\).
\item
  Prove that similar matrices (related by \(P^{-1}AP\)) represent the
  same linear transformation under different bases.
\item
  Diagonalize the matrix
  \(A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}\) in the basis
  \(\{(1,1),(1,-1)\}\).
\item
  In \(\mathbb{R}^3\), let
  \(\mathcal{B} = \{(1,0,0),(1,1,0),(1,1,1)\}\). Construct the
  change-of-basis matrix \(P\) and compute \(P^{-1}\).
\end{enumerate}

\section{Chapter 6. Determinants}\label{chapter-6-determinants}

\subsection{6.1 Motivation and Geometric
Meaning}\label{61-motivation-and-geometric-meaning}

Determinants are numerical values associated with square matrices. At
first they may appear as a complicated formula, but their importance
comes from what they measure: determinants encode scaling, orientation,
and invertibility of linear transformations. They bridge algebra and
geometry.

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Determinants of \(2 \times 2\)
Matrices}{Determinants of 2 \textbackslash times 2 Matrices}}\label{determinants-of--2-uxd7-2--matrices}

For a \(2 \times 2\) matrix

\[A = \begin{bmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{bmatrix},\]

the determinant is defined as

\[\det(A) = ad - bc.\]

Geometric meaning: If \(A\) represents a linear transformation of the
plane, then \(|\det(A)|\) is the area scaling factor. For example, if
\(\det(A) = 2\), areas of shapes are doubled. If \(\det(A) = 0\), the
transformation collapses the plane to a line: all area is lost.

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Determinants of \(3 \times 3\)
Matrices}{Determinants of 3 \textbackslash times 3 Matrices}}\label{determinants-of--3-uxd7-3--matrices}

For

\[A = \begin{bmatrix}
a & b & c \\
d & e & f \\
g & h & i
\end{bmatrix},\]

the determinant can be computed as

\[\det(A) = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg).\]

Geometric meaning: In \(\mathbb{R}^3\), \(|\det(A)|\) is the volume
scaling factor. If \(\det(A) < 0\), orientation is reversed (a
handedness flip), such as turning a right-handed coordinate system into
a left-handed one.

\subsubsection{General Case}\label{general-case}

For \(A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}\), the determinant is a scalar that
measures how the linear transformation given by \(A\) scales
n-dimensional volume.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  If \(\det(A) = 0\): the transformation squashes space into a lower
  dimension, so \(A\) is not invertible.
\item
  If \(\det(A) > 0\): volume is scaled by \(\det(A)\), orientation
  preserved.
\item
  If \(\det(A) < 0\): volume is scaled by \(|\det(A)|\), orientation
  reversed.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Visual Examples}\label{visual-examples}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Shear in \(\mathbb{R}^2\):\\
  \(A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}\).\\
  Then \(\det(A) = 1\). The transformation slants the unit square into a
  parallelogram but preserves area.
\item
  Projection in \(\mathbb{R}^2\):\\
  \(A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}\).\\
  Then \(\det(A) = 0\). The unit square collapses into a line segment:
  area vanishes.
\item
  Rotation in \(\mathbb{R}^2\):\\
  \(R_\theta = \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & -\sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & \cos\theta \end{bmatrix}\).\\
  Then \(\det(R_\theta) = 1\). Rotations preserve area and orientation.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Why this matters}\label{why-this-matters-20}

The determinant is not just a formula-it is a measure of transformation.
It tells us whether a matrix is invertible, how it distorts space, and
whether it flips orientation. This geometric insight makes the
determinant indispensable in analysis, geometry, and applied
mathematics.

\subsubsection{Exercises 6.1}\label{exercises-61}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Compute the determinant of
  \(\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 1 & 4 \end{bmatrix}\). What area scaling
  factor does it represent?
\item
  Find the determinant of the shear matrix
  \(\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}\). What happens to the
  area of the unit square?
\item
  For the \(3 \times 3\) matrix\\
  \(\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 2 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 3 \end{bmatrix}\),
  compute the determinant. How does it scale volume in \(\mathbb{R}^3\)?
\item
  Show that any rotation matrix in \(\mathbb{R}^2\) has determinant
  \(1\).
\item
  Give an example of a \(2 \times 2\) matrix with determinant \(-1\).
  What geometric action does it represent?
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{6.2 Properties of
Determinants}\label{62-properties-of-determinants}

Beyond their geometric meaning, determinants satisfy a collection of
algebraic rules that make them powerful tools in linear algebra. These
properties allow us to compute efficiently, test invertibility, and
understand how determinants behave under matrix operations.

\subsubsection{Basic Properties}\label{basic-properties}

Let \(A, B \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}\), and let \(c \in \mathbb{R}\).
Then:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Identity:

  \[\det(I_n) = 1.\]
\item
  Triangular matrices:\\
  If \(A\) is upper or lower triangular, then

  \[\det(A) = a_{11} a_{22} \cdots a_{nn}.\]
\item
  Row/column swap:\\
  Interchanging two rows (or columns) multiplies the determinant by
  \(-1\).
\item
  Row/column scaling:\\
  Multiplying a row (or column) by a scalar \(c\) multiplies the
  determinant by \(c\).
\item
  Row/column addition:\\
  Adding a multiple of one row to another does not change the
  determinant.
\item
  Transpose:

  \[\det(A^T) = \det(A).\]
\item
  Multiplicativity:

  \[\det(AB) = \det(A)\det(B).\]
\item
  Invertibility:\\
  \(A\) is invertible if and only if \(\det(A) \neq 0\).
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Example Computations}\label{example-computations}

Example 6.2.1.\\
For

\[A = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & 0 & 0 \\ 1 & 3 & 0 \\ -1 & 4 & 5 \end{bmatrix},\]

\(A\) is lower triangular, so

\[\det(A) = 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 = 30.\]

Example 6.2.2.\\
Let

\[B = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 3 & 4 \end{bmatrix}, \quad
C = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}.\]

Then

\[\det(B) = 1\cdot 4 - 2\cdot 3 = -2, \quad \det(C) = -1.\]

Since \(CB\) is obtained by swapping rows of \(B\),

\[\det(CB) = -\det(B) = 2.\]

This matches the multiplicativity rule:
\(\det(CB) = \det(C)\det(B) = (-1)(-2) = 2.\)

\subsubsection{Geometric Insights}\label{geometric-insights}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Row swaps: flipping orientation of space.
\item
  Scaling a row: stretching space in one direction.
\item
  Row replacement: sliding hyperplanes without altering volume.
\item
  Multiplicativity: performing two transformations multiplies their
  scaling factors.
\end{itemize}

These properties make determinants both computationally manageable and
geometrically interpretable.

\subsubsection{Why this matters}\label{why-this-matters-21}

Determinant properties connect computation with geometry and theory.
They explain why Gaussian elimination works, why invertibility is
equivalent to nonzero determinant, and why determinants naturally arise
in areas like volume computation, eigenvalue theory, and differential
equations.

\subsubsection{Exercises 6.2}\label{exercises-62}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Compute the determinant of

  \[A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\ 0 & 1 & 4 \\ 0 & 0 & 2 \end{bmatrix}.\]
\item
  Show that if two rows of a square matrix are identical, then its
  determinant is zero.
\item
  Verify \(\det(A^T) = \det(A)\) for

  \[A = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & -1 \\ 3 & 4 \end{bmatrix}.\]
\item
  If \(A\) is invertible, prove that

  \[\det(A^{-1}) = \frac{1}{\det(A)}.\]
\item
  Suppose \(A\) is a \(3\times 3\) matrix with \(\det(A) = 5\). What is
  \(\det(2A)\)?
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{6.3 Cofactor Expansion}\label{63-cofactor-expansion}

While determinants of small matrices can be computed directly from
formulas, larger matrices require a systematic method. The cofactor
expansion (also known as Laplace expansion) provides a recursive way to
compute determinants by breaking them into smaller ones.

\subsubsection{Minors and Cofactors}\label{minors-and-cofactors}

For an \(n \times n\) matrix \(A = [a_{ij}]\):

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The minor \(M_{ij}\) is the determinant of the \((n-1) \times (n-1)\)
  matrix obtained by deleting the \(i\)-th row and \(j\)-th column of
  \(A\).
\item
  The cofactor \(C_{ij}\) is defined by
\end{itemize}

\[C_{ij} = (-1)^{i+j} M_{ij}.\]

The sign factor \((-1)^{i+j}\) alternates in a checkerboard pattern:

\begin{bmatrix}
+ & - & + & - & \cdots \\
- & + & - & + & \cdots \\
+ & - & + & - & \cdots \\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots
\end{bmatrix}.

\subsubsection{Cofactor Expansion
Formula}\label{cofactor-expansion-formula}

The determinant of \(A\) can be computed by expanding along any row or
any column:

\[\det(A) = \sum_{j=1}^n a_{ij} C_{ij} \quad \text{(expansion along row \(i\))},\]

\[\det(A) = \sum_{i=1}^n a_{ij} C_{ij} \quad \text{(expansion along column \(j\))}.\]

\subsubsection{Example}\label{example-5}

Example 6.3.1.\\
Compute

\[A = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3 \\
0 & 4 & 5 \\
1 & 0 & 6
\end{bmatrix}.\]

Expand along the first row:

\[\det(A) = 1 \cdot C_{11} + 2 \cdot C_{12} + 3 \cdot C_{13}.\]

\begin{itemize}
\item
  For \(C_{11}\):\\
  \(M_{11} = \det \begin{bmatrix} 4 & 5 \\ 0 & 6 \end{bmatrix} = 24\),
  so \(C_{11} = (+1)(24) = 24\).
\item
  For \(C_{12}\):\\
  \(M_{12} = \det \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 5 \\ 1 & 6 \end{bmatrix} = 0 - 5 = -5\),
  so \(C_{12} = (-1)(-5) = 5\).
\item
  For \(C_{13}\):\\
  \(M_{13} = \det \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 4 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} = 0 - 4 = -4\),
  so \(C_{13} = (+1)(-4) = -4\).
\end{itemize}

Thus,

\[\det(A) = 1(24) + 2(5) + 3(-4) = 24 + 10 - 12 = 22.\]

\subsubsection{Properties of Cofactor
Expansion}\label{properties-of-cofactor-expansion}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Expansion along any row or column yields the same result.
\item
  The cofactor expansion provides a recursive definition of determinant:
  a determinant of size \(n\) is expressed in terms of determinants of
  size \(n-1\).
\item
  Cofactors are fundamental in constructing the adjugate matrix, which
  gives a formula for inverses:
\end{enumerate}

\[A^{-1} = \frac{1}{\det(A)} \, \text{adj}(A), \quad \text{where adj}(A) = [C_{ji}].\]

\subsubsection{Geometric
Interpretation}\label{geometric-interpretation-12}

Cofactor expansion breaks down the determinant into contributions from
sub-volumes defined by fixing one row or column at a time. Each cofactor
measures how that row/column influences the overall volume scaling.

\subsubsection{Why this matters}\label{why-this-matters-22}

Cofactor expansion generalizes the small-matrix formulas and provides a
conceptual definition of determinants. While not the most efficient way
to compute determinants for large matrices, it is essential for theory,
proofs, and connections to adjugates, Cramer's rule, and classical
geometry.

\subsubsection{Exercises 6.3}\label{exercises-63}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Compute the determinant of

  \begin{bmatrix}
  2 & 0 & 1 \\
  3 & -1 & 4 \\
  1 & 2 & 0
  \end{bmatrix}

  by cofactor expansion along the first column.
\item
  Verify that expanding along the second row of Example 6.3.1 gives the
  same determinant.
\item
  Prove that expansion along any row gives the same value.
\item
  Show that if a row of a matrix is zero, then its determinant is zero.
\item
  Use cofactor expansion to prove that \(\det(A) = \det(A^T)\).
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{6.4 Applications (Volume, Invertibility
Test)}\label{64-applications-volume-invertibility-test}

Determinants are not merely algebraic curiosities; they have concrete
geometric and computational uses. Two of the most important applications
are measuring volumes and testing invertibility of matrices.

\subsubsection{Determinants as Volume
Scalers}\label{determinants-as-volume-scalers}

Given vectors
\(\mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_2, \dots, \mathbf{v}_n \in \mathbb{R}^n\),
arrange them as columns of a matrix:

\[A = \begin{bmatrix}
| & | &  & | \\
\mathbf{v}_1 & \mathbf{v}_2 & \cdots & \mathbf{v}_n \\
| & | &  & |
\end{bmatrix}.\]

Then \(|\det(A)|\) equals the volume of the parallelepiped spanned by
these vectors.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  In \(\mathbb{R}^2\), \(|\det(A)|\) gives the area of the parallelogram
  spanned by \(\mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_2\).
\item
  In \(\mathbb{R}^3\), \(|\det(A)|\) gives the volume of the
  parallelepiped spanned by
  \(\mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_2, \mathbf{v}_3\).
\item
  In higher dimensions, it generalizes to \(n\)-dimensional volume
  (hypervolume).
\end{itemize}

Example 6.4.1.\\
Let

\[\mathbf{v}_1 = (1,0,0), \quad \mathbf{v}_2 = (1,1,0), \quad \mathbf{v}_3 = (1,1,1).\]

Then

\[A = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 1 & 1 \\
0 & 1 & 1 \\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}, \quad \det(A) = 1.\]

So the parallelepiped has volume \(1\), even though the vectors are not
orthogonal.

\subsubsection{Invertibility Test}\label{invertibility-test}

A square matrix \(A\) is invertible if and only if \(\det(A) \neq 0\).

\begin{itemize}
\item
  If \(\det(A) = 0\): the transformation collapses space into a lower
  dimension (area/volume is zero). No inverse exists.
\item
  If \(\det(A) \neq 0\): the transformation scales volume by
  \(|\det(A)|\), and is reversible.
\end{itemize}

Example 6.4.2.\\
The matrix

\[B = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & 4 \\ 1 & 2 \end{bmatrix}\]

has determinant \(\det(B) = 2 \cdot 2 - 4 \cdot 1 = 0\).\\
Thus, \(B\) is not invertible. Geometrically, the two column vectors are
collinear, spanning only a line in \(\mathbb{R}^2\).

\subsubsection{Cramer's Rule}\label{cramers-rule}

Determinants also provide an explicit formula for solving systems of
linear equations when the matrix is invertible. For
\(A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}\) with \(A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}\):

\[x_i = \frac{\det(A_i)}{\det(A)},\]

where \(A_i\) is obtained by replacing the \(i\)-th column of \(A\) with
\(\mathbf{b}\).\\
While inefficient computationally, Cramer's rule highlights the
determinant's role in solutions and uniqueness.

\subsubsection{Orientation}\label{orientation}

The sign of \(\det(A)\) indicates whether a transformation preserves or
reverses orientation. For example, a reflection in the plane has
determinant \(-1\), flipping handedness.

\subsubsection{Why this matters}\label{why-this-matters-23}

Determinants condense key information: they measure scaling, test
invertibility, and track orientation. These insights are indispensable
in geometry (areas and volumes), analysis (Jacobian determinants in
calculus), and computation (solving systems and checking singularity).

\subsubsection{Exercises 6.4}\label{exercises-64}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Compute the area of the parallelogram spanned by \((2,1)\) and
  \((1,3)\).
\item
  Find the volume of the parallelepiped spanned by
  \((1,0,0), (1,1,0), (1,1,1)\).
\item
  Determine whether the matrix
  \(\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 3 & 6 \end{bmatrix}\) is invertible.
  Justify using determinants.
\item
  Use Cramer's rule to solve

  \begin{cases}
  x + y = 3, \\
  2x - y = 0.
  \end{cases}
\item
  Explain geometrically why a determinant of zero implies no inverse
  exists.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Chapter 7. Inner Product
Spaces}\label{chapter-7-inner-product-spaces}

\subsection{7.1 Inner Products and
Norms}\label{71-inner-products-and-norms}

To extend the geometric ideas of length, distance, and angle beyond
\(\mathbb{R}^2\) and \(\mathbb{R}^3\), we introduce inner products.
Inner products provide a way of measuring similarity between vectors,
while norms derived from them measure length. These concepts are the
foundation of geometry inside vector spaces.

\subsubsection{Inner Product}\label{inner-product}

An inner product on a real vector space \(V\) is a function

\[\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle : V \times V \to \mathbb{R}\]

that assigns to each pair of vectors \((\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v})\) a real
number, subject to the following properties:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Symmetry:\\
  \(\langle \mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v} \rangle = \langle \mathbf{v}, \mathbf{u} \rangle.\)
\item
  Linearity in the first argument:\\
  \(\langle a\mathbf{u} + b\mathbf{w}, \mathbf{v} \rangle = a \langle \mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v} \rangle + b \langle \mathbf{w}, \mathbf{v} \rangle.\)
\item
  Positive-definiteness:\\
  \(\langle \mathbf{v}, \mathbf{v} \rangle \geq 0\), and equality holds
  if and only if \(\mathbf{v} = \mathbf{0}\).
\end{enumerate}

The standard inner product on \(\mathbb{R}^n\) is the dot product:

\[\langle \mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v} \rangle = u_1 v_1 + u_2 v_2 + \cdots + u_n v_n.\]

\subsubsection{Norms}\label{norms}

The norm of a vector is its length, defined in terms of the inner
product:

\[\|\mathbf{v}\| = \sqrt{\langle \mathbf{v}, \mathbf{v} \rangle}.\]

For the dot product in \(\mathbb{R}^n\):

\[\|(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n)\| = \sqrt{x_1^2 + x_2^2 + \cdots + x_n^2}.\]

\subsubsection{Angles Between Vectors}\label{angles-between-vectors-2}

The inner product allows us to define the angle \(\theta\) between two
nonzero vectors \(\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v}\) by

\[\cos \theta = \frac{\langle \mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v} \rangle}{\|\mathbf{u}\| \, \|\mathbf{v}\|}.\]

Thus, two vectors are orthogonal if
\(\langle \mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v} \rangle = 0\).

\subsubsection{Examples}\label{examples-6}

Example 7.1.1.\\
In \(\mathbb{R}^2\), with \(\mathbf{u} = (1,2)\),
\(\mathbf{v} = (3,4)\):

\[\langle \mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v} \rangle = 1\cdot 3 + 2\cdot 4 = 11.\]

\[\|\mathbf{u}\| = \sqrt{1^2 + 2^2} = \sqrt{5}, \quad \|\mathbf{v}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = 5.\]

So,

\[\cos \theta = \frac{11}{\sqrt{5}\cdot 5}.\]

Example 7.1.2.\\
In the function space \(C[0,1]\), the inner product

\[\langle f, g \rangle = \int_0^1 f(x) g(x)\, dx\]

defines a length

\[\|f\| = \sqrt{\int_0^1 f(x)^2 dx}.\]

This generalizes geometry to infinite-dimensional spaces.

\subsubsection{Geometric
Interpretation}\label{geometric-interpretation-13}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Inner product: measures similarity between vectors.
\item
  Norm: length of a vector.
\item
  Angle: measure of alignment between two directions.
\end{itemize}

These concepts unify algebraic operations with geometric intuition.

\subsubsection{Why this matters}\label{why-this-matters-24}

Inner products and norms allow us to extend geometry into abstract
vector spaces. They form the basis of orthogonality, projections,
Fourier series, least squares approximation, and many applications in
physics and machine learning.

\subsubsection{Exercises 7.1}\label{exercises-71}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Compute \(\langle (2,-1,3), (1,4,0) \rangle\). Then find the angle
  between them.
\item
  Show that \(\|(x,y)\| = \sqrt{x^2+y^2}\) satisfies the properties of a
  norm.
\item
  In \(\mathbb{R}^3\), verify that \((1,1,0)\) and \((1,-1,0)\) are
  orthogonal.
\item
  In \(C[0,1]\), compute \(\langle f,g \rangle\) for \(f(x)=x\),
  \(g(x)=1\).
\item
  Prove the Cauchy--Schwarz inequality:

  \[|\langle \mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v} \rangle| \leq \|\mathbf{u}\| \, \|\mathbf{v}\|.\]
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{7.2 Orthogonal Projections}\label{72-orthogonal-projections}

One of the most useful applications of inner products is the notion of
orthogonal projection. Projection allows us to approximate a vector by
another lying in a subspace, minimizing error in the sense of distance.
This idea underpins geometry, statistics, and numerical analysis.

\subsubsection{Projection onto a Line}\label{projection-onto-a-line}

Let \(\mathbf{u} \in \mathbb{R}^n\) be a nonzero vector. The line
spanned by \(\mathbf{u}\) is

\[L = \{ c\mathbf{u} \mid c \in \mathbb{R} \}.\]

Given a vector \(\mathbf{v}\), the projection of \(\mathbf{v}\) onto
\(\mathbf{u}\) is the vector in \(L\) closest to \(\mathbf{v}\).
Geometrically, it is the shadow of \(\mathbf{v}\) on the line.

The formula is

\[\text{proj}_{\mathbf{u}}(\mathbf{v}) = \frac{\langle \mathbf{v}, \mathbf{u} \rangle}{\langle \mathbf{u}, \mathbf{u} \rangle} \, \mathbf{u}.\]

The error vector \(\mathbf{v} - \text{proj}_{\mathbf{u}}(\mathbf{v})\)
is orthogonal to \(\mathbf{u}\).

\subsubsection{Example 7.2.1}\label{example-721}

Let \(\mathbf{u} = (1,2)\), \(\mathbf{v} = (3,1)\).

\[\langle \mathbf{v}, \mathbf{u} \rangle = 3\cdot 1 + 1\cdot 2 = 5, \quad 
\langle \mathbf{u}, \mathbf{u} \rangle = 1^2 + 2^2 = 5.\]

So

\[\text{proj}_{\mathbf{u}}(\mathbf{v}) = \frac{5}{5}(1,2) = (1,2).\]

The error vector is \((3,1) - (1,2) = (2,-1)\), which is orthogonal to
\((1,2)\).

\subsubsection{Projection onto a
Subspace}\label{projection-onto-a-subspace}

Suppose \(W \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n\) is a subspace with orthonormal
basis \(\{ \mathbf{w}_1, \dots, \mathbf{w}_k \}\). The projection of a
vector \(\mathbf{v}\) onto \(W\) is

\[\text{proj}_{W}(\mathbf{v}) = \langle \mathbf{v}, \mathbf{w}_1 \rangle \mathbf{w}_1 + \cdots + \langle \mathbf{v}, \mathbf{w}_k \rangle \mathbf{w}_k.\]

This is the unique vector in \(W\) closest to \(\mathbf{v}\). The
difference \(\mathbf{v} - \text{proj}_{W}(\mathbf{v})\) is orthogonal to
all of \(W\).

\subsubsection{Least Squares
Approximation}\label{least-squares-approximation}

Orthogonal projection explains the method of least squares. To solve an
overdetermined system \(A\mathbf{x} \approx \mathbf{b}\), we seek the
\(\mathbf{x}\) that makes \(A\mathbf{x}\) the projection of
\(\mathbf{b}\) onto the column space of \(A\). This gives the normal
equations

\[A^T A \mathbf{x} = A^T \mathbf{b}.\]

Thus, least squares is just projection in disguise.

\subsubsection{Geometric
Interpretation}\label{geometric-interpretation-14}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Projection finds the closest point in a subspace to a given vector.
\item
  It minimizes distance (error) in the sense of Euclidean norm.
\item
  Orthogonality ensures the error vector points directly away from the
  subspace.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Why this matters}\label{why-this-matters-25}

Orthogonal projection is central in both pure and applied mathematics.
It underlies the geometry of subspaces, the theory of Fourier series,
regression in statistics, and approximation methods in numerical linear
algebra. Whenever we fit data with a simpler model, projection is at
work.

\subsubsection{Exercises 7.2}\label{exercises-72}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Compute the projection of \((2,3)\) onto the vector \((1,1)\).
\item
  Show that \(\mathbf{v} - \text{proj}_{\mathbf{u}}(\mathbf{v})\) is
  orthogonal to \(\mathbf{u}\).
\item
  Let \(W = \text{span}\{(1,0,0), (0,1,0)\} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^3\).
  Find the projection of \((1,2,3)\) onto \(W\).
\item
  Explain why least squares fitting corresponds to projection onto the
  column space of \(A\).
\item
  Prove that projection onto a subspace \(W\) is unique: there is
  exactly one closest vector in \(W\) to a given \(\mathbf{v}\).
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{7.3 Gram--Schmidt Process}\label{73-gram--schmidt-process}

The Gram--Schmidt process is a systematic way to turn any linearly
independent set of vectors into an orthonormal basis. This is especially
useful because orthonormal bases simplify computations: inner products
become simple coordinate comparisons, and projections take clean forms.

\subsubsection{The Idea}\label{the-idea}

Given a linearly independent set of vectors
\(\{\mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_2, \dots, \mathbf{v}_n\}\) in an inner
product space, we want to construct an orthonormal set
\(\{\mathbf{u}_1, \mathbf{u}_2, \dots, \mathbf{u}_n\}\) that spans the
same subspace.

We proceed step by step:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Start with \(\mathbf{v}_1\), normalize it to get \(\mathbf{u}_1\).
\item
  Subtract from \(\mathbf{v}_2\) its projection onto \(\mathbf{u}_1\),
  leaving a vector orthogonal to \(\mathbf{u}_1\). Normalize to get
  \(\mathbf{u}_2\).
\item
  For each \(\mathbf{v}_k\), subtract projections onto all previously
  constructed \(\mathbf{u}_1, \dots, \mathbf{u}_{k-1}\), then normalize.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{The Algorithm}\label{the-algorithm}

For \(k = 1, 2, \dots, n\):

\[\mathbf{w}_k = \mathbf{v}_k - \sum_{j=1}^{k-1} \langle \mathbf{v}_k, \mathbf{u}_j \rangle \mathbf{u}_j,\]

\[\mathbf{u}_k = \frac{\mathbf{w}_k}{\|\mathbf{w}_k\|}.\]

The result \(\{\mathbf{u}_1, \dots, \mathbf{u}_n\}\) is an orthonormal
basis of the span of the original vectors.

\subsubsection{Example 7.3.1}\label{example-731}

Take
\(\mathbf{v}_1 = (1,1,0), \ \mathbf{v}_2 = (1,0,1), \ \mathbf{v}_3 = (0,1,1)\)
in \(\mathbb{R}^3\).

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Normalize \(\mathbf{v}_1\):
\end{enumerate}

\[\mathbf{u}_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(1,1,0).\]

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Subtract projection of \(\mathbf{v}_2\) on \(\mathbf{u}_1\):
\end{enumerate}

\[\mathbf{w}_2 = \mathbf{v}_2 - \langle \mathbf{v}_2,\mathbf{u}_1 \rangle \mathbf{u}_1.\]

\[\langle \mathbf{v}_2,\mathbf{u}_1 \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(1\cdot 1 + 0\cdot 1 + 1\cdot 0) = \tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}.\]

So

\[\mathbf{w}_2 = (1,0,1) - \tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\cdot \tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(1,1,0) 
= (1,0,1) - \tfrac{1}{2}(1,1,0) 
= \left(\tfrac{1}{2}, -\tfrac{1}{2}, 1\right).\]

Normalize:

\[\mathbf{u}_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\tfrac{1}{4}+\tfrac{1}{4}+1}} \left(\tfrac{1}{2}, -\tfrac{1}{2}, 1\right)
= \frac{1}{\sqrt{\tfrac{3}{2}}}\left(\tfrac{1}{2}, -\tfrac{1}{2}, 1\right).\]

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Subtract projections from \(\mathbf{v}_3\):
\end{enumerate}

\[\mathbf{w}_3 = \mathbf{v}_3 - \langle \mathbf{v}_3,\mathbf{u}_1 \rangle \mathbf{u}_1 - \langle \mathbf{v}_3,\mathbf{u}_2 \rangle \mathbf{u}_2.\]

After computing, normalize to obtain \(\mathbf{u}_3\).

The result is an orthonormal basis of the span of
\(\{\mathbf{v}_1,\mathbf{v}_2,\mathbf{v}_3\}\).

\subsubsection{Geometric
Interpretation}\label{geometric-interpretation-15}

Gram--Schmidt is like straightening out a set of vectors: you start with
the original directions and adjust each new vector to be perpendicular
to all previous ones. Then you scale to unit length. The process ensures
orthogonality while preserving the span.

\subsubsection{Why this matters}\label{why-this-matters-26}

Orthonormal bases simplify inner products, projections, and computations
in general. They make coordinate systems easier to work with and are
crucial in numerical methods, QR decomposition, Fourier analysis, and
statistics (orthogonal polynomials, principal component analysis).

\subsubsection{Exercises 7.3}\label{exercises-73}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Apply Gram--Schmidt to \((1,0), (1,1)\) in \(\mathbb{R}^2\).
\item
  Orthogonalize \((1,1,1), (1,0,1)\) in \(\mathbb{R}^3\).
\item
  Prove that each step of Gram--Schmidt yields a vector orthogonal to
  all previous ones.
\item
  Show that Gram--Schmidt preserves the span of the original vectors.
\item
  Explain how Gram--Schmidt leads to the QR decomposition of a matrix.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{7.4 Orthonormal Bases}\label{74-orthonormal-bases}

An orthonormal basis is a basis of a vector space in which all vectors
are both orthogonal to each other and have unit length. Such bases are
the most convenient possible coordinate systems: computations involving
inner products, projections, and norms become exceptionally simple.

\subsubsection{Definition}\label{definition-4}

A set of vectors \(\{\mathbf{u}_1, \mathbf{u}_2, \dots, \mathbf{u}_n\}\)
in an inner product space \(V\) is called an orthonormal basis if

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \(\langle \mathbf{u}_i, \mathbf{u}_j \rangle = 0\) whenever
  \(i \neq j\) (orthogonality),
\item
  \(\|\mathbf{u}_i\| = 1\) for all \(i\) (normalization),
\item
  The set spans \(V\).
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Examples}\label{examples-7}

Example 7.4.1. In \(\mathbb{R}^2\), the standard basis

\[\mathbf{e}_1 = (1,0), \quad \mathbf{e}_2 = (0,1)\]

is orthonormal under the dot product.

Example 7.4.2. In \(\mathbb{R}^3\), the standard basis

\[\mathbf{e}_1 = (1,0,0), \quad \mathbf{e}_2 = (0,1,0), \quad \mathbf{e}_3 = (0,0,1)\]

is orthonormal.

Example 7.4.3. Fourier basis on functions:

\[\{1, \cos x, \sin x, \cos 2x, \sin 2x, \dots\}\]

is an orthogonal set in the space of square-integrable functions on
\([-\pi,\pi]\) with inner product

\[\langle f,g \rangle = \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} f(x) g(x)\, dx.\]

After normalization, it becomes an orthonormal basis.

\subsubsection{Properties}\label{properties}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Coordinate simplicity: If \(\{\mathbf{u}_1,\dots,\mathbf{u}_n\}\) is
  an orthonormal basis of \(V\), then any vector \(\mathbf{v}\in V\) has
  coordinates

  \[[\mathbf{v}] = \begin{bmatrix} \langle \mathbf{v}, \mathbf{u}_1 \rangle \\ \vdots \\ \langle \mathbf{v}, \mathbf{u}_n \rangle \end{bmatrix}.\]

  That is, coordinates are just inner products.
\item
  Parseval's identity:\\
  For any \(\mathbf{v} \in V\),

  \[\|\mathbf{v}\|^2 = \sum_{i=1}^n |\langle \mathbf{v}, \mathbf{u}_i \rangle|^2.\]
\item
  Projections:\\
  The orthogonal projection onto the span of
  \(\{\mathbf{u}_1,\dots,\mathbf{u}_k\}\) is

  \[\text{proj}(\mathbf{v}) = \sum_{i=1}^k \langle \mathbf{v}, \mathbf{u}_i \rangle \mathbf{u}_i.\]
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Constructing Orthonormal
Bases}\label{constructing-orthonormal-bases}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Start with any linearly independent set, then apply the Gram--Schmidt
  process to obtain an orthonormal set spanning the same subspace.
\item
  In practice, orthonormal bases are often chosen for numerical
  stability and simplicity of computation.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Geometric
Interpretation}\label{geometric-interpretation-16}

An orthonormal basis is like a perfectly aligned and equally scaled
coordinate system. Distances and angles are computed directly using
coordinates without correction factors. They are the ideal rulers of
linear algebra.

\subsubsection{Why this matters}\label{why-this-matters-27}

Orthonormal bases simplify every aspect of linear algebra: solving
systems, computing projections, expanding functions, diagonalizing
symmetric matrices, and working with Fourier series. In data science,
principal component analysis produces orthonormal directions capturing
maximum variance.

\subsubsection{Exercises 7.4}\label{exercises-74}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Verify that \((1/\sqrt{2})(1,1)\) and \((1/\sqrt{2})(1,-1)\) form an
  orthonormal basis of \(\mathbb{R}^2\).
\item
  Express \((3,4)\) in terms of the orthonormal basis
  \(\{(1/\sqrt{2})(1,1), (1/\sqrt{2})(1,-1)\}\).
\item
  Prove Parseval's identity for \(\mathbb{R}^n\) with the dot product.
\item
  Find an orthonormal basis for the plane \(x+y+z=0\) in
  \(\mathbb{R}^3\).
\item
  Explain why orthonormal bases are numerically more stable than
  arbitrary bases in computations.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Chapter 8. Eigenvalues and
eigenvectors}\label{chapter-8-eigenvalues-and-eigenvectors}

\subsection{8.1 Definitions and
Intuition}\label{81-definitions-and-intuition}

The concepts of eigenvalues and eigenvectors reveal the most fundamental
behavior of linear transformations. They identify the special directions
in which a transformation acts by simple stretching or compressing,
without rotation or distortion.

\subsubsection{Definition}\label{definition-5}

Let \(T: V \to V\) be a linear transformation on a vector space \(V\). A
nonzero vector \(\mathbf{v} \in V\) is called an eigenvector of \(T\) if

\[T(\mathbf{v}) = \lambda \mathbf{v}\]

for some scalar \(\lambda \in \mathbb{R}\) (or \(\mathbb{C}\)). The
scalar \(\lambda\) is the eigenvalue corresponding to \(\mathbf{v}\).

Equivalently, if \(A\) is the matrix of \(T\), then eigenvalues and
eigenvectors satisfy

\[A\mathbf{v} = \lambda \mathbf{v}.\]

\subsubsection{Basic Examples}\label{basic-examples}

Example 8.1.1.\\
Let

\[A = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 0 & 3 \end{bmatrix}.\]

Then

\[A(1,0)^T = 2(1,0)^T, \quad A(0,1)^T = 3(0,1)^T.\]

So \((1,0)\) is an eigenvector with eigenvalue \(2\), and \((0,1)\) is
an eigenvector with eigenvalue \(3\).

Example 8.1.2.\\
Rotation matrix in \(\mathbb{R}^2\):

\[R_\theta = \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & -\sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & \cos\theta \end{bmatrix}.\]

If \(\theta \neq 0, \pi\), \(R_\theta\) has no real eigenvalues: every
vector is rotated, not scaled. Over \(\mathbb{C}\), however, it has
eigenvalues \(e^{i\theta}, e^{-i\theta}\).

\subsubsection{Algebraic Formulation}\label{algebraic-formulation}

Eigenvalues arise from solving the characteristic equation:

\[\det(A - \lambda I) = 0.\]

This polynomial in \(\lambda\) is the characteristic polynomial. Its
roots are the eigenvalues.

\subsubsection{Geometric Intuition}\label{geometric-intuition}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Eigenvectors are directions that remain unchanged in orientation under
  a transformation; only their length is scaled.
\item
  Eigenvalues tell us the scaling factor along those directions.
\item
  If a matrix has many independent eigenvectors, it can often be
  simplified (diagonalized) by changing basis.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Applications in Geometry and
Science}\label{applications-in-geometry-and-science}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Stretching along principal axes of an ellipse (quadratic forms).
\item
  Stable directions of dynamical systems.
\item
  Principal components in statistics and machine learning.
\item
  Quantum mechanics, where observables correspond to operators with
  eigenvalues.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Why this matters}\label{why-this-matters-28}

Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are a bridge between algebra and geometry.
They provide a lens for understanding linear transformations in their
simplest form. Nearly every application of linear algebra-differential
equations, statistics, physics, computer science-relies on
eigen-analysis.

\subsubsection{Exercises 8.1}\label{exercises-81}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of\\
  \(\begin{bmatrix} 4 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}\).
\item
  Show that every scalar multiple of an eigenvector is again an
  eigenvector for the same eigenvalue.
\item
  Verify that the rotation matrix \(R_\theta\) has no real eigenvalues
  unless \(\theta = 0\) or \(\pi\).
\item
  Compute the characteristic polynomial of\\
  \(\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 2 & 1 \end{bmatrix}\).
\item
  Explain geometrically what eigenvectors and eigenvalues represent for
  the shear matrix\\
  \(\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}\).
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{8.2 Diagonalization}\label{82-diagonalization}

A central goal in linear algebra is to simplify the action of a matrix
by choosing a good basis. Diagonalization is the process of rewriting a
matrix so that it acts by simple scaling along independent directions.
This makes computations such as powers, exponentials, and solving
differential equations far easier.

\subsubsection{Definition}\label{definition-6}

A square matrix \(A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}\) is diagonalizable if
there exists an invertible matrix \(P\) such that

\[P^{-1} A P = D,\]

where \(D\) is a diagonal matrix.

The diagonal entries of \(D\) are eigenvalues of \(A\), and the columns
of \(P\) are the corresponding eigenvectors.

\subsubsection{When is a Matrix
Diagonalizable?}\label{when-is-a-matrix-diagonalizable}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  A matrix is diagonalizable if it has \(n\) linearly independent
  eigenvectors.
\item
  Equivalently, the sum of the dimensions of its eigenspaces equals
  \(n\).
\item
  Symmetric matrices (over \(\mathbb{R}\)) are always diagonalizable,
  with an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Example 8.2.1}\label{example-821}

Let

\[A = \begin{bmatrix} 4 & 1 \\ 0 & 2 \end{bmatrix}.\]

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Characteristic polynomial:
\end{enumerate}

\[\det(A - \lambda I) = (4-\lambda)(2-\lambda).\]

So eigenvalues are \(\lambda_1 = 4\), \(\lambda_2 = 2\).

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Eigenvectors:
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  For \(\lambda = 4\), solve \((A-4I)\mathbf{v}=0\):\\
  \(\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 0 & -2 \end{bmatrix}\mathbf{v} = 0\),
  giving \(\mathbf{v}_1 = (1,0)\).
\item
  For \(\lambda = 2\): \((A-2I)\mathbf{v}=0\), giving
  \(\mathbf{v}_2 = (1,-2)\).
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Construct \(P = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 0 & -2 \end{bmatrix}\). Then
\end{enumerate}

\[P^{-1} A P = \begin{bmatrix} 4 & 0 \\ 0 & 2 \end{bmatrix}.\]

Thus, \(A\) is diagonalizable.

\subsubsection{Why Diagonalize?}\label{why-diagonalize}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Computing powers:\\
  If \(A = P D P^{-1}\), then

  \[A^k = P D^k P^{-1}.\]

  Since \(D\) is diagonal, \(D^k\) is easy to compute.
\item
  Matrix exponentials:\\
  \(e^A = P e^D P^{-1}\), useful in solving differential equations.
\item
  Understanding geometry:\\
  Diagonalization reveals the directions along which a transformation
  stretches or compresses space independently.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Non-Diagonalizable
Example}\label{non-diagonalizable-example}

Not all matrices can be diagonalized.

\[A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}\]

has only one eigenvalue \(\lambda = 1\), with eigenspace dimension 1.
Since \(n=2\) but we only have 1 independent eigenvector, \(A\) is not
diagonalizable.

\subsubsection{Geometric
Interpretation}\label{geometric-interpretation-17}

Diagonalization means we have found a basis of eigenvectors. In this
basis, the matrix acts by simple scaling along each coordinate axis. It
transforms complicated motion into independent 1D motions.

\subsubsection{Why this matters}\label{why-this-matters-29}

Diagonalization is a cornerstone of linear algebra. It simplifies
computation, reveals structure, and is the starting point for the
spectral theorem, Jordan form, and many applications in physics,
engineering, and data science.

\subsubsection{Exercises 8.2}\label{exercises-82}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Diagonalize

  \[A = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 0 & 3 \end{bmatrix}.\]
\item
  Determine whether

  \[A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}\]

  is diagonalizable. Why or why not?
\item
  Find \(A^5\) for

  \[A = \begin{bmatrix} 4 & 1 \\ 0 & 2 \end{bmatrix}\]

  using diagonalization.
\item
  Show that any \(n \times n\) matrix with \(n\) distinct eigenvalues is
  diagonalizable.
\item
  Explain why real symmetric matrices are always diagonalizable.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{8.3 Characteristic
Polynomials}\label{83-characteristic-polynomials}

The key to finding eigenvalues is the characteristic polynomial of a
matrix. This polynomial encodes the values of \(\lambda\) for which the
matrix \(A - \lambda I\) fails to be invertible.

\subsubsection{Definition}\label{definition-7}

For an \(n \times n\) matrix \(A\), the characteristic polynomial is

\[p_A(\lambda) = \det(A - \lambda I).\]

The roots of \(p_A(\lambda)\) are the eigenvalues of \(A\).

\subsubsection{Examples}\label{examples-8}

Example 8.3.1.\\
Let

\[A = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & 1 \\ 1 & 2 \end{bmatrix}.\]

Then

\[p_A(\lambda) = \det\!\begin{bmatrix} 2-\lambda & 1 \\ 1 & 2-\lambda \end{bmatrix}
= (2-\lambda)^2 - 1 = \lambda^2 - 4\lambda + 3.\]

Thus eigenvalues are \(\lambda = 1, 3\).

Example 8.3.2.\\
For

\[A = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}\]

(rotation by 90°),

\[p_A(\lambda) = \det\!\begin{bmatrix} -\lambda & -1 \\ 1 & -\lambda \end{bmatrix}
= \lambda^2 + 1.\]

Eigenvalues are \(\lambda = \pm i\). No real eigenvalues exist,
consistent with pure rotation.

Example 8.3.3.\\
For a triangular matrix

\[A = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 3 & 5 \\ 0 & 0 & 4 \end{bmatrix},\]

the determinant is simply the product of diagonal entries minus
\(\lambda\):

\[p_A(\lambda) = (2-\lambda)(3-\lambda)(4-\lambda).\]

So eigenvalues are \(2, 3, 4\).

\subsubsection{Properties}\label{properties-2}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  The characteristic polynomial of an \(n \times n\) matrix has degree
  \(n\).
\item
  The sum of the eigenvalues (counted with multiplicity) equals the
  trace of \(A\):

  \[\text{tr}(A) = \lambda_1 + \cdots + \lambda_n.\]
\item
  The product of the eigenvalues equals the determinant of \(A\):

  \[\det(A) = \lambda_1 \cdots \lambda_n.\]
\item
  Similar matrices have the same characteristic polynomial, hence the
  same eigenvalues.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Geometric
Interpretation}\label{geometric-interpretation-18}

The characteristic polynomial captures when \(A - \lambda I\) collapses
space: its determinant is zero precisely when the transformation
\(A - \lambda I\) is singular. Thus, eigenvalues mark the critical
scalings where the matrix loses invertibility.

\subsubsection{Why this matters}\label{why-this-matters-30}

Characteristic polynomials provide the computational tool to extract
eigenvalues. They connect matrix invariants (trace and determinant) with
geometry, and form the foundation for diagonalization, spectral
theorems, and stability analysis in dynamical systems.

\subsubsection{Exercises 8.3}\label{exercises-83}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Compute the characteristic polynomial of

  \[A = \begin{bmatrix} 4 & 2 \\ 1 & 3 \end{bmatrix}.\]
\item
  Verify that the sum of the eigenvalues of\\
  \(\begin{bmatrix} 5 & 0 \\ 0 & -2 \end{bmatrix}\)\\
  equals its trace, and their product equals its determinant.
\item
  Show that for any triangular matrix, the eigenvalues are just the
  diagonal entries.
\item
  Prove that if \(A\) and \(B\) are similar matrices, then
  \(p_A(\lambda) = p_B(\lambda)\).
\item
  Compute the characteristic polynomial of\\
  \(\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}\).
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{8.4 Applications (Differential Equations, Markov
Chains)}\label{84-applications-differential-equations-markov-chains}

Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are not only central to the theory of
linear algebra-they are indispensable tools across mathematics and
applied science. Two classic applications are solving systems of
differential equations and analyzing Markov chains.

\subsubsection{Linear Differential
Equations}\label{linear-differential-equations}

Consider the system

\[\frac{d\mathbf{x}}{dt} = A \mathbf{x},\]

where \(A\) is an \(n \times n\) matrix and \(\mathbf{x}(t)\) is a
vector-valued function.

If \(\mathbf{v}\) is an eigenvector of \(A\) with eigenvalue
\(\lambda\), then the function

\[\mathbf{x}(t) = e^{\lambda t}\mathbf{v}\]

is a solution.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Eigenvalues determine the growth or decay rate:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    If \(\lambda < 0\), solutions decay (stable).
  \item
    If \(\lambda > 0\), solutions grow (unstable).
  \item
    If \(\lambda\) is complex, oscillations occur.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

By combining eigenvector solutions, we can solve general initial
conditions.

Example 8.4.1.\\
Let

\[A = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}.\]

Then eigenvalues are \(2, -1\) with eigenvectors \((1,0)\), \((0,1)\).
Solutions are

\[\mathbf{x}(t) = c_1 e^{2t}(1,0) + c_2 e^{-t}(0,1).\]

Thus one component grows exponentially, the other decays.

\subsubsection{Markov Chains}\label{markov-chains}

A Markov chain is described by a stochastic matrix \(P\), where each
column sums to 1 and entries are nonnegative. If \(\mathbf{x}_k\)
represents the probability distribution after \(k\) steps, then

\[\mathbf{x}_{k+1} = P \mathbf{x}_k.\]

Iterating gives

\[\mathbf{x}_k = P^k \mathbf{x}_0.\]

Understanding long-term behavior reduces to analyzing powers of \(P\).

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The eigenvalue \(\lambda = 1\) always exists. Its eigenvector gives
  the steady-state distribution.
\item
  All other eigenvalues satisfy \(|\lambda| \leq 1\). Their influence
  decays as \(k \to \infty\).
\end{itemize}

Example 8.4.2.\\
Consider

\[P = \begin{bmatrix} 0.9 & 0.5 \\ 0.1 & 0.5 \end{bmatrix}.\]

Eigenvalues are \(\lambda_1 = 1\), \(\lambda_2 = 0.4\). The eigenvector
for \(\lambda = 1\) is proportional to \((5,1)\). Normalizing gives the
steady state

\[\pi = \left(\tfrac{5}{6}, \tfrac{1}{6}\right).\]

Thus, regardless of the starting distribution, the chain converges to
\(\pi\).

\subsubsection{Geometric
Interpretation}\label{geometric-interpretation-19}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  In differential equations, eigenvalues determine the time evolution:
  exponential growth, decay, or oscillation.
\item
  In Markov chains, eigenvalues determine the long-term equilibrium of
  stochastic processes.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Why this matters}\label{why-this-matters-31}

Eigenvalue methods turn complex iterative or dynamical systems into
tractable problems. In physics, engineering, and finance, they describe
stability and resonance. In computer science and statistics, they power
algorithms from Google's PageRank to modern machine learning.

\subsubsection{Exercises 8.4}\label{exercises-84}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Solve
  \(\tfrac{d}{dt}\mathbf{x} = \begin{bmatrix} 3 & 0 \\ 0 & -2 \end{bmatrix}\mathbf{x}\).
\item
  Show that if \(A\) has a complex eigenvalue \(\alpha \pm i\beta\),
  then solutions of \(\tfrac{d}{dt}\mathbf{x} = A\mathbf{x}\) involve
  oscillations of frequency \(\beta\).
\item
  Find the steady-state distribution of

  \[P = \begin{bmatrix} 0.7 & 0.2 \\ 0.3 & 0.8 \end{bmatrix}.\]
\item
  Prove that for any stochastic matrix \(P\), \(1\) is always an
  eigenvalue.
\item
  Explain why all eigenvalues of a stochastic matrix satisfy
  \(|\lambda| \leq 1\).
\end{enumerate}

\section{Chapter 9. Quadratic Forms and Spectral
Theorems}\label{chapter-9-quadratic-forms-and-spectral-theorems}

\subsection{9.1 Quadratic Forms}\label{91-quadratic-forms}

A quadratic form is a polynomial of degree two in several variables,
expressed neatly using matrices. Quadratic forms appear throughout
mathematics: in optimization, geometry of conic sections, statistics
(variance), and physics (energy functions).

\subsubsection{Definition}\label{definition-8}

Let \(A\) be an \(n \times n\) symmetric matrix and
\(\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n\). The quadratic form associated with
\(A\) is

\[Q(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{x}^T A \mathbf{x}.\]

Expanded,

\[Q(\mathbf{x}) = \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n a_{ij} x_i x_j.\]

Because \(A\) is symmetric (\(a_{ij} = a_{ji}\)), the cross-terms can be
grouped naturally.

\subsubsection{Examples}\label{examples-9}

Example 9.1.1.\\
For

\[A = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & 1 \\ 1 & 3 \end{bmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{x} = \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \end{bmatrix},\]

\[Q(x,y) = \begin{bmatrix} x & y \end{bmatrix} 
\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 1 \\ 1 & 3 \end{bmatrix} 
\begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \end{bmatrix}
= 2x^2 + 2xy + 3y^2.\]

Example 9.1.2.\\
The quadratic form

\[Q(x,y) = x^2 + y^2\]

corresponds to the matrix \(A = I_2\). It measures squared Euclidean
distance from the origin.

Example 9.1.3.\\
The conic section equation

\[4x^2 + 2xy + 5y^2 = 1\]

is described by the quadratic form \(\mathbf{x}^T A \mathbf{x} = 1\)
with

\[A = \begin{bmatrix} 4 & 1 \\ 1 & 5 \end{bmatrix}.\]

\subsubsection{Diagonalization of Quadratic
Forms}\label{diagonalization-of-quadratic-forms}

By choosing a new basis consisting of eigenvectors of \(A\), we can
rewrite the quadratic form without cross terms. If \(A = PDP^{-1}\) with
\(D\) diagonal, then

\[Q(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{x}^T A \mathbf{x} = (P^{-1}\mathbf{x})^T D (P^{-1}\mathbf{x}).\]

Thus quadratic forms can always be expressed as a sum of weighted
squares:

\[Q(\mathbf{y}) = \lambda_1 y_1^2 + \cdots + \lambda_n y_n^2,\]

where \(\lambda_i\) are the eigenvalues of \(A\).

\subsubsection{Geometric
Interpretation}\label{geometric-interpretation-20}

Quadratic forms describe geometric shapes:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  In 2D: ellipses, parabolas, hyperbolas.
\item
  In 3D: ellipsoids, paraboloids, hyperboloids.
\item
  In higher dimensions: generalizations of ellipsoids.
\end{itemize}

Diagonalization aligns the coordinate axes with the principal axes of
the shape.

\subsubsection{Why this matters}\label{why-this-matters-32}

Quadratic forms unify geometry and algebra. They are central in
optimization (minimizing energy functions), statistics (covariance
matrices and variance), mechanics (kinetic energy), and numerical
analysis. Understanding quadratic forms leads directly to the spectral
theorem.

\subsubsection{Exercises 9.1}\label{exercises-91}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Write the quadratic form \(Q(x,y) = 3x^2 + 4xy + y^2\) as
  \(\mathbf{x}^T A \mathbf{x}\) for some symmetric matrix \(A\).
\item
  For \(A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 2 & 1 \end{bmatrix}\), compute
  \(Q(x,y)\) explicitly.
\item
  Diagonalize the quadratic form \(Q(x,y) = 2x^2 + 2xy + 3y^2\).
\item
  Identify the conic section given by \(Q(x,y) = x^2 - y^2\).
\item
  Show that if \(A\) is symmetric, quadratic forms defined by \(A\) and
  \(A^T\) are identical.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{9.2 Positive Definite
Matrices}\label{92-positive-definite-matrices}

Quadratic forms are especially important when their associated matrices
are positive definite, since these guarantee positivity of energy,
distance, or variance. Positive definiteness is a cornerstone in
optimization, numerical analysis, and statistics.

\subsubsection{Definition}\label{definition-9}

A symmetric matrix \(A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}\) is called:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Positive definite if

  \[\mathbf{x}^T A \mathbf{x} > 0 \quad \text{for all nonzero } \mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n.\]
\item
  Positive semidefinite if

  \[\mathbf{x}^T A \mathbf{x} \geq 0 \quad \text{for all } \mathbf{x}.\]
\end{itemize}

Similarly, negative definite (always \textless{} 0) and indefinite (can
be both \textless{} 0 and \textgreater{} 0) matrices are defined.

\subsubsection{Examples}\label{examples-10}

Example 9.2.1.

\[A = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 0 & 3 \end{bmatrix}\]

is positive definite, since

\[Q(x,y) = 2x^2 + 3y^2 > 0\]

for all \((x,y) \neq (0,0)\).

Example 9.2.2.

\[A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 2 & 1 \end{bmatrix}\]

has quadratic form

\[Q(x,y) = x^2 + 4xy + y^2.\]

This matrix is not positive definite, since \(Q(1,-1) = -2 < 0\).

\subsubsection{Characterizations}\label{characterizations}

For a symmetric matrix \(A\):

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Eigenvalue test: \(A\) is positive definite if and only if all
  eigenvalues of \(A\) are positive.
\item
  Principal minors test (Sylvester's criterion): \(A\) is positive
  definite if and only if all leading principal minors (determinants of
  top-left \(k \times k\) submatrices) are positive.
\item
  Cholesky factorization: \(A\) is positive definite if and only if it
  can be written as

  \[A = R^T R,\]

  where \(R\) is an upper triangular matrix with positive diagonal
  entries.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Geometric
Interpretation}\label{geometric-interpretation-21}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Positive definite matrices correspond to quadratic forms that define
  ellipsoids centered at the origin.
\item
  Positive semidefinite matrices define flattened ellipsoids (possibly
  degenerate).
\item
  Indefinite matrices define hyperbolas or saddle-shaped surfaces.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Applications}\label{applications}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Optimization: Hessians of convex functions are positive semidefinite;
  strict convexity corresponds to positive definite Hessians.
\item
  Statistics: Covariance matrices are positive semidefinite.
\item
  Numerical methods: Cholesky decomposition is widely used to solve
  systems with positive definite matrices efficiently.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Why this matters}\label{why-this-matters-33}

Positive definiteness provides stability and guarantees in mathematics
and computation. It ensures energy functions are bounded below,
optimization problems have unique solutions, and statistical models are
meaningful.

\subsubsection{Exercises 9.2}\label{exercises-92}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Use Sylvester's criterion to check whether

  \[A = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & -1 \\ -1 & 2 \end{bmatrix}\]

  is positive definite.
\item
  Determine whether

  \[A = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}\]

  is positive definite, semidefinite, or indefinite.
\item
  Find the eigenvalues of

  \[A = \begin{bmatrix} 4 & 2 \\ 2 & 3 \end{bmatrix},\]

  and use them to classify definiteness.
\item
  Prove that all diagonal matrices with positive entries are positive
  definite.
\item
  Show that if \(A\) is positive definite, then so is \(P^T A P\) for
  any invertible matrix \(P\).
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{9.3 Spectral Theorem}\label{93-spectral-theorem}

The spectral theorem is one of the most powerful results in linear
algebra. It states that symmetric matrices can always be diagonalized by
an orthogonal basis of eigenvectors. This links algebra (eigenvalues),
geometry (orthogonal directions), and applications (stability,
optimization, statistics).

\subsubsection{Statement of the Spectral
Theorem}\label{statement-of-the-spectral-theorem}

If \(A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}\) is symmetric (\(A^T = A\)), then:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  All eigenvalues of \(A\) are real.
\item
  There exists an orthonormal basis of \(\mathbb{R}^n\) consisting of
  eigenvectors of \(A\).
\item
  Thus, \(A\) can be written as

  \[A = Q \Lambda Q^T,\]

  where \(Q\) is an orthogonal matrix (\(Q^T Q = I\)) and \(\Lambda\) is
  diagonal with eigenvalues of \(A\) on the diagonal.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Consequences}\label{consequences}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Symmetric matrices are always diagonalizable, and the diagonalization
  is numerically stable.
\item
  Quadratic forms \(\mathbf{x}^T A \mathbf{x}\) can be expressed in
  terms of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, showing ellipsoids aligned with
  eigen-directions.
\item
  Positive definiteness can be checked by confirming that all
  eigenvalues are positive.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Example 9.3.1}\label{example-931}

Let

\[A = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & 1 \\ 1 & 2 \end{bmatrix}.\]

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Characteristic polynomial:
\end{enumerate}

\[p(\lambda) = (2-\lambda)^2 - 1 = \lambda^2 - 4\lambda + 3.\]

Eigenvalues: \(\lambda_1 = 1, \ \lambda_2 = 3\).

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Eigenvectors:
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  For \(\lambda=1\): solve \((A-I)\mathbf{v} = 0\), giving \((1,-1)\).
\item
  For \(\lambda=3\): solve \((A-3I)\mathbf{v} = 0\), giving \((1,1)\).
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Normalize eigenvectors:
\end{enumerate}

\[\mathbf{u}_1 = \tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(1,-1), \quad \mathbf{u}_2 = \tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(1,1).\]

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Then
\end{enumerate}

\[Q = \begin{bmatrix} \tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & \tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \[6pt] -\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & \tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \end{bmatrix}, \quad 
\Lambda = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 3 \end{bmatrix}.\]

So

\[A = Q \Lambda Q^T.\]

\subsubsection{Geometric
Interpretation}\label{geometric-interpretation-22}

The spectral theorem says every symmetric matrix acts like independent
scaling along orthogonal directions. In geometry, this corresponds to
stretching space along perpendicular axes.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Ellipses, ellipsoids, and quadratic surfaces can be fully understood
  via eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
\item
  Orthogonality ensures directions remain perpendicular after
  transformation.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Applications}\label{applications-2}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Optimization: The spectral theorem underlies classification of
  critical points via eigenvalues of the Hessian.
\item
  PCA (Principal Component Analysis): Data covariance matrices are
  symmetric, and PCA finds orthogonal directions of maximum variance.
\item
  Differential equations \& physics: Symmetric operators correspond to
  measurable quantities with real eigenvalues (stability, energy).
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Why this matters}\label{why-this-matters-34}

The spectral theorem guarantees that symmetric matrices are as simple as
possible: they can always be analyzed in terms of real, orthogonal
eigenvectors. This provides both deep theoretical insight and powerful
computational tools.

\subsubsection{Exercises 9.3}\label{exercises-93}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Diagonalize

  \[A = \begin{bmatrix} 4 & 2 \\ 2 & 3 \end{bmatrix}\]

  using the spectral theorem.
\item
  Prove that all eigenvalues of a real symmetric matrix are real.
\item
  Show that eigenvectors corresponding to distinct eigenvalues of a
  symmetric matrix are orthogonal.
\item
  Explain geometrically how the spectral theorem describes ellipsoids
  defined by quadratic forms.
\item
  Apply the spectral theorem to the covariance matrix

  \[\Sigma = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & 1 \\ 1 & 2 \end{bmatrix},\]

  and interpret the eigenvectors as principal directions of variance.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{9.4 Principal Component Analysis
(PCA)}\label{94-principal-component-analysis-pca}

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a widely used technique in data
science, machine learning, and statistics. At its core, PCA is an
application of the spectral theorem to covariance matrices: it finds
orthogonal directions (principal components) that capture the maximum
variance in data.

\subsubsection{The Idea}\label{the-idea-2}

Given a dataset of vectors
\(\mathbf{x}_1, \mathbf{x}_2, \dots, \mathbf{x}_m \in \mathbb{R}^n\):

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Center the data by subtracting the mean vector \(\bar{\mathbf{x}}\).
\item
  Form the covariance matrix

  \[\Sigma = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m (\mathbf{x}_i - \bar{\mathbf{x}})(\mathbf{x}_i - \bar{\mathbf{x}})^T.\]
\item
  Apply the spectral theorem: \(\Sigma = Q \Lambda Q^T\).

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Columns of \(Q\) are orthonormal eigenvectors (principal
    directions).
  \item
    Eigenvalues in \(\Lambda\) measure variance explained by each
    direction.
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

The first principal component is the eigenvector corresponding to the
largest eigenvalue; it is the direction of maximum variance.

\subsubsection{Example 9.4.1}\label{example-941}

Suppose we have two-dimensional data points roughly aligned along the
line \(y = x\). The covariance matrix is approximately

\[\Sigma = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & 1.9 \\ 1.9 & 2 \end{bmatrix}.\]

Eigenvalues are about \(3.9\) and \(0.1\). The eigenvector for
\(\lambda = 3.9\) is approximately \((1,1)/\sqrt{2}\).

\begin{itemize}
\item
  First principal component: the line \(y = x\).
\item
  Most variance lies along this direction.
\item
  Second component is nearly orthogonal (\(y = -x\)), but variance there
  is tiny.
\end{itemize}

Thus PCA reduces the data to essentially one dimension.

\subsubsection{Applications of PCA}\label{applications-of-pca}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Dimensionality reduction: Represent data with fewer features while
  retaining most variance.
\item
  Noise reduction: Small eigenvalues correspond to noise; discarding
  them filters data.
\item
  Visualization: Projecting high-dimensional data onto top 2 or 3
  principal components reveals structure.
\item
  Compression: PCA is used in image and signal compression.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Connection to the Spectral
Theorem}\label{connection-to-the-spectral-theorem}

The covariance matrix \(\Sigma\) is always symmetric and positive
semidefinite. Hence by the spectral theorem, it has an orthonormal basis
of eigenvectors and nonnegative real eigenvalues. PCA is nothing more
than re-expressing data in this eigenbasis.

\subsubsection{Why this matters}\label{why-this-matters-35}

PCA demonstrates how abstract linear algebra directly powers modern
applications. Eigenvalues and eigenvectors give a practical method for
simplifying data, revealing patterns, and reducing complexity. It is one
of the most important algorithms derived from the spectral theorem.

\subsubsection{Exercises 9.4}\label{exercises-94}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Show that the covariance matrix is symmetric and positive
  semidefinite.
\item
  Compute the covariance matrix of the dataset \((1,2), (2,3), (3,4)\),
  and find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
\item
  Explain why the first principal component captures the maximum
  variance.
\item
  In image compression, explain how PCA can reduce storage by keeping
  only the top \(k\) principal components.
\item
  Prove that the sum of the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix equals
  the total variance of the dataset.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Chapter 10. Linear Algebra in

\subsection{10.1 Computer Graphics (Rotations,
Projections)}\label{101-computer-graphics-rotations-projections}

Linear algebra is the language of modern computer graphics. Every image
rendered on a screen, every 3D model rotated or projected, is ultimately
the result of applying matrices to vectors. Rotations, reflections,
scalings, and projections are all linear transformations, making
matrices the natural tool for manipulating geometry.

\subsubsection{Rotations in 2D}\label{rotations-in-2d}

A counterclockwise rotation by an angle \(\theta\) in the plane is
represented by

\[R_\theta = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\cos\theta & -\sin\theta \\
\sin\theta & \cos\theta
\end{bmatrix}.\]

For any vector \(\mathbf{v} \in \mathbb{R}^2\), the rotated vector is

\[\mathbf{v}' = R_\theta \mathbf{v}.\]

This preserves lengths and angles, since \(R_\theta\) is orthogonal with
determinant \(1\).

\subsubsection{Rotations in 3D}\label{rotations-in-3d}

In three dimensions, rotations are represented by \(3 \times 3\)
orthogonal matrices with determinant \(1\). For example, a rotation
about the \(z\)-axis is

\[R_z(\theta) = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\cos\theta & -\sin\theta & 0 \\
\sin\theta & \cos\theta & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}.\]

Similar formulas exist for rotations about the \(x\)- and \(y\)-axes.

More general 3D rotations can be described by axis--angle representation
or quaternions, but the underlying idea is still linear transformations
represented by matrices.

\subsubsection{Projections}\label{projections-2}

To display 3D objects on a 2D screen, we use projections:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Orthogonal projection: drops the \(z\)-coordinate, mapping
  \((x,y,z) \mapsto (x,y)\).

  \[P = \begin{bmatrix}
  1 & 0 & 0 \\
  0 & 1 & 0
  \end{bmatrix}.\]
\item
  Perspective projection: mimics the effect of a camera. A point
  \((x,y,z)\) projects to

  \[\left(\frac{x}{z}, \frac{y}{z}\right),\]

  capturing how distant objects appear smaller.
\end{enumerate}

These operations are linear (orthogonal projection) or nearly linear
(perspective projection becomes linear in homogeneous coordinates).

\subsubsection{Homogeneous Coordinates}\label{homogeneous-coordinates}

To unify translations and projections with linear transformations,
computer graphics uses homogeneous coordinates. A 3D point \((x,y,z)\)
is represented as a 4D vector \((x,y,z,1)\). Transformations are then
\(4 \times 4\) matrices, which can represent rotations, scalings, and
translations in a single framework.

Example: Translation by \((a,b,c)\):

\[T = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & a \\
0 & 1 & 0 & b \\
0 & 0 & 1 & c \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}.\]

\subsubsection{Geometric
Interpretation}\label{geometric-interpretation-23}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Rotations preserve shape and size, only changing orientation.
\item
  Projections reduce dimension: from 3D world space to 2D screen space.
\item
  Homogeneous coordinates allow us to combine multiple transformations
  (rotation + translation + projection) into a single matrix
  multiplication.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Why this matters}\label{why-this-matters-36}

Linear algebra enables all real-time graphics: video games, simulations,
CAD software, and movie effects. By chaining simple matrix operations,
complex transformations are applied efficiently to millions of points
per second.

\subsubsection{Exercises 10.1}\label{exercises-101}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Write the rotation matrix for a 90° counterclockwise rotation in
  \(\mathbb{R}^2\). Apply it to \((1,0)\).
\item
  Rotate the point \((1,1,0)\) about the \(z\)-axis by 180°.
\item
  Show that the determinant of any 2D or 3D rotation matrix is 1.
\item
  Derive the orthogonal projection matrix from \(\mathbb{R}^3\) to the
  \(xy\)-plane.
\item
  Explain how homogeneous coordinates allow translations to be
  represented as matrix multiplications.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{10.2 Data Science (Dimensionality Reduction, Least
Squares)}\label{102-data-science-dimensionality-reduction-least-squares}

Linear algebra provides the foundation for many data science techniques.
Two of the most important are dimensionality reduction, where
high-dimensional datasets are compressed while preserving essential
information, and the least squares method, which underlies regression
and model fitting.

\subsubsection{Dimensionality Reduction}\label{dimensionality-reduction}

High-dimensional data often contains redundancy: many features are
correlated, meaning the data essentially lies near a lower-dimensional
subspace. Dimensionality reduction identifies these subspaces.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  PCA (Principal Component Analysis):\\
  As introduced earlier, PCA diagonalizes the covariance matrix of the
  data.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Eigenvectors (principal components) define orthogonal directions of
    maximum variance.
  \item
    Eigenvalues measure how much variance lies along each direction.
  \item
    Keeping only the top \(k\) components reduces data from
    \(n\)-dimensional space to \(k\)-dimensional space while retaining
    most variability.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Example 10.2.1. A dataset of 1000 images, each with 1024 pixels, may
have most variance captured by just 50 eigenvectors of the covariance
matrix. Projecting onto these components compresses the data while
preserving essential features.

\subsubsection{Least Squares}\label{least-squares}

Often, we have more equations than unknowns-an overdetermined system:

\[A\mathbf{x} \approx \mathbf{b}, \quad A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}, \ m > n.\]

An exact solution may not exist. Instead, we seek \(\mathbf{x}\) that
minimizes the error

\[\|A\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{b}\|^2.\]

This leads to the normal equations:

\[A^T A \mathbf{x} = A^T \mathbf{b}.\]

The solution is the orthogonal projection of \(\mathbf{b}\) onto the
column space of \(A\).

\subsubsection{Example 10.2.2}\label{example-1022}

Fit a line \(y = mx + c\) to data points \((x_i, y_i)\).

Matrix form:

\[A = \begin{bmatrix}
x_1 & 1 \\
x_2 & 1 \\
\vdots & \vdots \\
x_m & 1
\end{bmatrix}, 
\quad 
\mathbf{b} = \begin{bmatrix} y_1 \\ y_2 \\ \vdots \\ y_m \end{bmatrix},
\quad 
\mathbf{x} = \begin{bmatrix} m \\ c \end{bmatrix}.\]

Solve \(A^T A \mathbf{x} = A^T \mathbf{b}\). This yields the best-fit
line in the least squares sense.

\subsubsection{Geometric
Interpretation}\label{geometric-interpretation-24}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Dimensionality reduction: Find the best subspace capturing most
  variance.
\item
  Least squares: Project the target vector onto the subspace spanned by
  predictors.
\end{itemize}

Both are projection problems, solved using inner products and
orthogonality.

\subsubsection{Why this matters}\label{why-this-matters-37}

Dimensionality reduction makes large datasets tractable, filters noise,
and reveals structure. Least squares fitting powers regression,
statistics, and machine learning. Both rely directly on eigenvalues,
eigenvectors, and projections-core tools of linear algebra.

\subsubsection{Exercises 10.2}\label{exercises-102}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Explain why PCA reduces noise in datasets by discarding small
  eigenvalue components.
\item
  Compute the least squares solution to fitting a line through
  \((0,0), (1,1), (2,2)\).
\item
  Show that the least squares solution is unique if and only if
  \(A^T A\) is invertible.
\item
  Prove that the least squares solution minimizes the squared error by
  projection arguments.
\item
  Apply PCA to the data points \((1,0), (2,1), (3,2)\) and find the
  first principal component.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{10.3 Networks and Markov
Chains}\label{103-networks-and-markov-chains}

Graphs and networks provide a natural setting where linear algebra comes
to life. From modeling flows and connectivity to predicting long-term
behavior, matrices translate network structure into algebraic form.
Markov chains, already introduced in Section 8.4, are a central example
of networks evolving over time.

\subsubsection{Adjacency Matrices}\label{adjacency-matrices}

A network (graph) with \(n\) nodes can be represented by an adjacency
matrix \(A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}\):

\[A_{ij} =
\begin{cases}
1 & \text{if there is an edge from node \(i\) to node \(j\)} \\
0 & \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}\]

For weighted graphs, entries may be positive weights instead of \(0/1\).

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The number of walks of length \(k\) from node \(i\) to node \(j\) is
  given by the entry \((A^k)_{ij}\).
\item
  Powers of adjacency matrices thus encode connectivity over time.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Laplacian Matrices}\label{laplacian-matrices}

Another important matrix is the graph Laplacian:

\[L = D - A,\]

where \(D\) is the diagonal degree matrix
(\(D_{ii} = \text{degree}(i)\)).

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \(L\) is symmetric and positive semidefinite.
\item
  The smallest eigenvalue is always \(0\), with eigenvector
  \((1,1,\dots,1)\).
\item
  The multiplicity of eigenvalue \(0\) equals the number of connected
  components in the graph.
\end{itemize}

This connection between eigenvalues and connectivity forms the basis of
spectral graph theory.

\subsubsection{Markov Chains on Graphs}\label{markov-chains-on-graphs}

A Markov chain can be viewed as a random walk on a graph. If \(P\) is
the transition matrix where \(P_{ij}\) is the probability of moving from
node \(i\) to node \(j\), then

\[\mathbf{x}_{k+1} = P \mathbf{x}_k\]

describes the distribution of positions after \(k\) steps.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The steady-state distribution is given by the eigenvector of \(P\)
  with eigenvalue \(1\).
\item
  The speed of convergence depends on the gap between the largest
  eigenvalue (which is always \(1\)) and the second largest eigenvalue.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Example 10.3.1}\label{example-1031}

Consider a simple 3-node cycle graph:

\[P = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & 0
\end{bmatrix}.\]

This Markov chain cycles deterministically among the nodes. Eigenvalues
are the cube roots of unity: \(1, e^{2\pi i/3}, e^{4\pi i/3}\). The
eigenvalue \(1\) corresponds to the steady state, which is the uniform
distribution \((1/3,1/3,1/3)\).

\subsubsection{Applications}\label{applications-3}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Search engines: Google's PageRank algorithm models the web as a Markov
  chain, where steady-state probabilities rank pages.
\item
  Network analysis: Eigenvalues of adjacency or Laplacian matrices
  reveal communities, bottlenecks, and robustness.
\item
  Epidemiology and information flow: Random walks model how diseases or
  ideas spread through networks.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Why this matters}\label{why-this-matters-38}

Linear algebra transforms network problems into matrix problems.
Eigenvalues and eigenvectors reveal connectivity, flow, stability, and
long-term dynamics. Networks are everywhere-social media, biology,
finance, and the internet-so these tools are indispensable.

\subsubsection{Exercises 10.3}\label{exercises-103}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Write the adjacency matrix of a square graph with 4 nodes. Compute
  \(A^2\) and interpret the entries.
\item
  Show that the Laplacian of a connected graph has exactly one zero
  eigenvalue.
\item
  Find the steady-state distribution of the Markov chain with

  \[P = \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 & 0.5 \\ 0.4 & 0.6 \end{bmatrix}.\]
\item
  Explain how eigenvalues of the Laplacian can detect disconnected
  components of a graph.
\item
  Describe how PageRank modifies the transition matrix of the web graph
  to ensure a unique steady-state distribution.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{10.4 Machine Learning
Connections}\label{104-machine-learning-connections}

Modern machine learning is built on linear algebra. From the
representation of data as matrices to the optimization of large-scale
models, nearly every step relies on concepts such as vector spaces,
projections, eigenvalues, and matrix decompositions.

\subsubsection{Data as Matrices}\label{data-as-matrices}

A dataset with \(m\) examples and \(n\) features is represented as a
matrix \(X \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}\):

\[X = 
\begin{bmatrix}
- & \mathbf{x}_1^T & - \\
- & \mathbf{x}_2^T & - \\
  & \vdots &  \\
- & \mathbf{x}_m^T & -
\end{bmatrix},\]

where each row \(\mathbf{x}_i \in \mathbb{R}^n\) is a feature vector.
Linear algebra provides tools to analyze, compress, and transform this
data.

\subsubsection{Linear Models}\label{linear-models}

At the heart of machine learning are linear predictors:

\[\hat{y} = X\mathbf{w},\]

where \(\mathbf{w}\) is the weight vector. Training often involves
solving a least squares problem or a regularized variant such as ridge
regression:

\[\min_{\mathbf{w}} \|X\mathbf{w} - \mathbf{y}\|^2 + \lambda \|\mathbf{w}\|^2.\]

This is solved efficiently using matrix factorizations.

\subsubsection{Singular Value Decomposition
(SVD)}\label{singular-value-decomposition-svd}

The SVD of a matrix \(X\) is

\[X = U \Sigma V^T,\]

where \(U, V\) are orthogonal and \(\Sigma\) is diagonal with
nonnegative entries (singular values).

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Singular values measure the importance of directions in feature space.
\item
  SVD is used for dimensionality reduction (low-rank approximations),
  topic modeling, and recommender systems.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Eigenvalues in Machine
Learning}\label{eigenvalues-in-machine-learning}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  PCA (Principal Component Analysis): diagonalization of the covariance
  matrix identifies directions of maximal variance.
\item
  Spectral clustering: uses eigenvectors of the Laplacian to group data
  points into clusters.
\item
  Stability analysis: eigenvalues of Hessian matrices determine whether
  optimization converges to a minimum.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Neural Networks}\label{neural-networks}

Even deep learning, though nonlinear, uses linear algebra at its core:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Each layer is a matrix multiplication followed by a nonlinear
  activation.
\item
  Training requires computing gradients, which are expressed in terms of
  matrix calculus.
\item
  Backpropagation is essentially repeated applications of the chain rule
  with linear algebra.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Why this matters}\label{why-this-matters-39}

Machine learning models often involve datasets with millions of features
and parameters. Linear algebra provides the algorithms and abstractions
that make training and inference possible. Without it, large-scale
computation in AI would be intractable.

\subsubsection{Exercises 10.4}\label{exercises-104}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Show that ridge regression leads to the normal equations

  \[(X^T X + \lambda I)\mathbf{w} = X^T \mathbf{y}.\]
\item
  Explain how SVD can be used to compress an image represented as a
  matrix of pixel intensities.
\item
  For a covariance matrix \(\Sigma\), show why its eigenvalues represent
  variances along principal components.
\item
  Give an example of how eigenvectors of the Laplacian matrix can be
  used for clustering a small graph.
\item
  In a neural network with one hidden layer, write the forward pass in
  matrix form.
\end{enumerate}
